In 1988, Indiana University advertised for an assistant professor in population biology, with emphasis on disease ecology. Lynda and I both applied. Happily, we were offered a split position in Biology in which we each got half salary. It may not sound like a good deal, but we were thrilled. It is not easy for a dual-career couple in the same field. We relocated to Bloomington in January of 1990, arriving during a cold snap (-20&degC). We moved into a university house; but we did not know enough to have the electricity turned on before arrival. Luckily, we still had our down sleeping bags, which we had purchased for field work in the Southern Alps. Aside from the chilly start, moving to Bloomington was the beginning of an academic dream come true. Most of this book aims to highlight the work of my incredible students and colleagues at IU.
