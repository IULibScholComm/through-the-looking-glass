    "text": "About\nThe following pages represent the first six chapters of a book (part 1). The main goal was to present an introduction to the problem of sexual reproduction, with a focus on competition between sexual and asexual females. But I also incorporated some ideas on genetic polymorphism and phenotypic plasticity with the aim of exploring “variation strategies” more generally. Finally, I tried to weave in some history of the field, along with some philosophy of science."

    "section": "\n1.1 The Question",
    "text": "1.1 The Question\nMost PhD programs require that students pass a preliminary examination. This was certainly true in my case. I was a PhD student at the University of Arizona studying rocky intertidal communities in the Northern Gulf of California. But the exams were not focused on our research. They were “depth-of-knowledge” exams. My question from Prof. Astrid Kodric-Brown instructed me to read the preface of G.C. Williams’ book, Sex and Evolution, which contains the following text (Williams 1975):\n\nThis book is written from a conviction that the prevalence of sexual reproduction in higher plants and animals is inconsistent with current evolutionary theory…. Many well informed readers may disagree with much of my reasoning, but I hope to at least convince them that here is a crisis at hand in evolutionary biology…\n\nThe question was something like this: why does Williams think that sexual reproduction poses a crisis for evolutionary biology, and what is the solution? A crisis? That was news to me. How could there be a crisis on evolutionary biology 40-plus years after the modern synthesis? My graduate course in theoretical population genetics did not mention any crises. I was not convinced. And a little freaked out.\nThe structure of our exams was very loose. I don’t remember having a deadline to produce a written answer, but I do remember that I spent several months on just this one question. During much of this time, I was doing field work in Sonora, Mexico, sometimes under very harsh conditions. But the more I studied the question, the more fascinated I became. I came to think that there was, indeed, a very real anomaly presented by sexual reproduction. Williams was right. Perhaps I was especially interested in this anomaly because I had read Thomas Kuhn’s “The Structure of Scientific Revolutions” as an undergraduate (Kuhn 1970). Kuhn made the case that dissecting anomalies can lead to interesting advances, and that made sense to me. While I eventually produced an essay to address the question, the answer felt incomplete. I wanted to know more. There were many hypotheses, but there was no clear general explanation. Many years later, I am still working on my prelim question. This book is my revised answer."

    "section": "\n1.2 The Problem",
    "text": "1.2 The Problem\nThere are many problems with sexual reproduction, including the time spent finding mates and the risk of contracting sexually transmitted disease (review in Lehtonen et al. 2012). However, while important, these costs do not form the core of the paradox. Historically, the paradox of sex stems from two things: (1) the cost of meiosis, and (2) the cost of producing males.\n\n1.2.1 The cost of meiosis: reduced relatedness\nThe “cost of meiosis” was proposed by George Williams (1975). His idea was simply that females are only half as related to their outcrossed offspring as they are to their self-fertilized or parthenogenetic offspring1. (See Box 1.1 for condensed definitions.) Williams’ idea also had theoretical support, as R.A. Fisher had already shown that an allele causing self-fertilization would rapidly spread to fixation, barring severe inbreeding depression (Fisher 1941). So, why cross-fertilize? The persistence of cross-fertilization despite the cost of meiosis formed a paradox. This paradox created the crisis that Williams saw in evolutionary biology.\n\n1.2.2 The cost of males\nThe other way to look at the problem was proposed by John Maynard Smith (Maynard Smith 1971, 1978). Here the issue is not relatedness. The problem stems rather from the difference between sexuals and asexuals in their per-capita birth rates (Figure 1.1). Imagine a population of sexual individuals at carrying capacity (\\(K_{sex}\\)). At \\(K_{sex}\\) the sexual females are, by definition, simply replacing themselves. This means that each sexual female is, on average, producing one son and one daughter. Both sons and daughters contribute genetically to the next generation, but only females give birth. Now, consider a mutation in a single female that causes her to reproduce asexually. She gives birth to two daughters instead of one daughter and one son. These two asexually produced daughters both give birth to two more daughters. Hence, after just two generations, the asexual female has four granddaughters, while the average sexual female has just one granddaughter (Figure 1.1). This asymmetry should lead to the rapid replacement sexual females by asexual females (Figure 1.2). And by \"rapid,\" I mean within tens of generations, even for very large populations (Lively 1996). We thus seek a selective force that can give an advantage to sexual reproduction on a very short time scale.\n\n\nFigure 1.1: The cost of males. Imagine a single clonal female in a sexual population at carrying capacity, \\(K_{sex}\\). At \\(K_{sex}\\), the sexual females are, on average, producing one daughter and one son. In contrast, the clonal female produces two daughters and four granddaughters. Hence, the clonal lineage should rapidly eliminate the sexual population (Figure 1.2). However, in nature, asexual reproduction is very rare in both plants (Whitton et al. 2008) and animals (Vrijenhoek 1998). Hence the paradox. Why is sexual reproduction so costly and yet so common?\n\nSeveral assumptions went into Maynard Smith's model for the cost of males. In particular, he assumed that sexual females and asexual females make the same number of offspring, and that the survivorship of these offspring is also the same. Maynard Smith referred to this as the “all-else-equal assumption.” Unfortunately, some authors have taken the phrase “all-else-equal” to mean that everything else is exactly equal. But this is not the case. Maynard Smith did not assume, for example, that sexuals and asexuals have the same ploidy value2. His model only assumes that sexual and asexual females have equal fecundities and survivorship probabilities (see Box 1.2). Under this assumption, a very rare clone would double in frequency in the next generation. Maynard Smith called this doubling-when-rare the two-fold cost of sex.\n\n1.2.3 Contrasting the costs\nThe two alternative costs of sex raise an immediate question. Does the cost of sex result from reduced relatedness between mother and offspring, or from the cost of producing males? Or is the cost some combination of both? These questions are not easy to answer; but there is an algebraic solution, which suggests that the (1) two costs are mutually exclusive and (2) that they apply to different kinds of uniparental progeny (Lively and Lloyd 1990). Roughly speaking, I think we can adopt the following rules for the purpose of this book. When considering the spread of a rare allele that induces self-fertilization in hermaphrodites, the appropriate cost is Williams' cost of meiosis. Here we have a single population in which the selfing allele is under positive selection, because it has a transmission advantage. On the other hand, when we consider the spread of a clone into an obligately sexual population, we are dealing with competition between two different reproductively isolated groups. One group (the sexuals) produces males, which do not make offspring. The other group (asexuals) produces only females. Here the cost of sex stems from producing males. But the two costs do not combine. The cost of sex is not four-fold.\n\nR code for clonal invasion dynamics simulation visualizationlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\na = 1e-04  #a is a constant that gives the sensitivity to total population density\nd = 1  # d is the death rate.
