abstract = {Abstract One explanation for the extraordinary diversity of tropical forest trees is that density-dependent mortality from herbivores or pathogens puts locally rare species at an advantage. Density-dependent mortality of seeds and small seedlings is particularly intense in tropical forests, but its causes remain uncertain. Here, we show experimentally that pathogens from the Oomycota are associated with intense mortality in seedlings of a neotropical tree, Sebastiana longicuspis. Seedlings in untreated plots experienced eight times higher mortality compared with seedlings in plots treated with fungicide. Mortality was strongly density dependent: in fungicide-treated plots survival was unaffected by density, but survival in unsprayed plots was over three times higher at low density. Density-dependent mortality observed in a simultaneous, non-manipulative study was highly transient, suggesting that short-term observational studies may underestimate the intensity and form of pathogen-induced mortality. If such effects are widespread, plant pathogens may play a key role in maintaining and structuring tropical diversity.},

Williams and John Maynard Smith arrived at slightly different conclusions about the evolutionary maintenance of sexual reproduction, despite that both were staunch neo-Darwinians, simply because they approached the problem from different angles (life history vs. population genetics). This difference between their perspectives made them notice the so-called paradox of sexual reproduction for the first time. That is, Williams and Maynard Smith used their difference in perspective constructively, in order to raise a problem that had previously been overlooked by ?monocular? views. Evidence from before, during and after the recognition of the paradox supports this thesis of constructive difference. First, Maynard Smith had diagnosed the individual cost of sexual reproduction in full detail by 1958, but nobody raised an eyebrow for a decade. Second, both the correspondence between Williams and Maynard Smith and their publications show that they saw the same problem but against different backgrounds, because they viewed it from different perspectives. Third, further differences between Williams and Maynard Smith concerning the evolution of sex make no sense except in the light of the initial difference in their perspectives.}

Models of host-parasite co-evolution often assume that infection requires specific combinations of host and parasite genotypes. Co-evolving host and parasite loci are, therefore, expected to show associations that reflect an underlying infection/resistance allele matrix, yet little evidence for such genome-to-genome interactions has been observed among natural populations. We conducted a study to search for this genomic signature across 258 linked host (Daphnia magna) and parasite (Pasteuria ramosa) genomes. Our results show a clear signal of genomic association between multiple epistatically interacting loci in the host genome, and a family of genes encoding for collagen-like protein in the parasite genome. These findings are supported by laboratory-based infection trials, which show strong correspondence between phenotype and genotype at the identified loci. Our study provides clear genomic evidence of antagonistic co-evolution among wild populations.},

abstract = {Abstract The nature of the selective forces responsible for the maintenance of sexual reproduction in populations remains controversial. Theoreticians have proposed a variety of mechanisms to explain how sex is adaptive, including varying environments, sib competition, mutational damage, and pathogens. In a well-studied population of the short-lived, perennial grass Anthoxanthum odoratum in a mown North Carolina field, significant fitness advantages for sexual vs. asexual offspring have been shown. Evidence from two recent experiments implicates barley yellow dwarf luteovirus (BYDV), a single-stranded RNA virus, as a cause of the short-term advantage for sex in this population. When planted in sites close to parents, asexual offspring were twice as frequently infected as sexual offspring. In other sites, infection was more frequent among common than rare genotypes. Viruses possess a unique combination of features which make them plausible candidates to favor sexual reproduction in plants. Viruses are pervasive, have subtle but significant fitness effects, have the potential for rapid mutation and evolution, and are spread by vectors whose behaviors are host frequency dependent. The ecological and evolutionary consequences of viruses in plant populations deserve further study.},

In order for sex to be maintained in populations, sex must confer immediate and substantial fitness benefits. Theoreticians have proposed numerous mechanisms to explain how such advantages arise, but experimental data are few. In one well-studied population of the perennial grass Anthoxanthum odoratum in a mown North Carolina field, sexual offspring have been found to have significantly higher fitness than asexual offspring. More recent field experiments show that an aphid-transmitted virus, barley yellow dwarf (BYDV)-strain SGV, specifically transmitted by Schizaphus graminum, frequently infects Anthoxanthum progeny soon after transplantation into the field, BYDV infection is asymptomatic in Anthoxanthum, but BYDV-inoculated clones planted directly in the field had significantly lower fitness than healthy controls. Sexual females have been hypothesized to gain a fitness advantage for their offspring in the presence of pathogens either by providing ‘an escape in time’ from pathogens preadapted to the parental genotype or through the production of rare genotypes, which escape frequency-dependent infection. When parental clones and seed-derived sexual offspring were planted in identical but separate arrays in sites near where the parent was collected, parental clones were twice as frequently infected as sexual offspring. Factors other than genetic variation may have contributed to differences in levels of infection between sexual and asexual progeny: in this experiment, clonally derived asexual offspring tillers were slightly larger than seed-derived sexual tillers; in field experiments, larger plants were more frequently infected than smaller plants. When different families were planted into a common site, there was evidence that genotypes were less frequently infected when locally rare than when common. Taken together, the data suggest that BYDV infection generates advantages for rare or sexually produced genotypes in Anthoxanthum. The pattern of infection is likely to result from a complex interaction between vector, host, and viral genetics and population structure, vector behaviour, and host and vector dispersal patterns. Sexually produced genotypes appear to benefit because they are both novel and rare, but the observed minority advantage was weak. Other viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens in this Anthoxanthum population may act as frequency-dependent selective forces in different places in the field, collectively generating the substantial and observed overall fitness advantage of rare genotypes. Further study is needed to elucidate their role. Nevertheless, the data do show that viral pathogens, which are often asymptomatic, play a significant evolutionary role in plant populations. }

abstract = {The geographic mosaic theory of coevolution is predicated on structured populations of interacting species where gene flow and the force of selection can vary among populations, leading to a mosaic of traits in space. Here, I briefly review some recent studies of adaptation by a sterilizing parasite to structured populations of a freshwater snail. The results show geographic structure as expected under the geographic mosaic model. I then consider the effects of virulence and migration on local adaptation by parasites using a computer simulation. The results suggest that high virulence and low migration contribute to the strength of local adaptation by parasites. Highly virulent parasites showed adaptation to local hosts for migration rates of up to 10\% of the population per generation. In addition, because of the dynamic nature of host‐parasite coevolution, the magnitude of local adaptation fluctuates over time. During some points in the cycle, parasites may be no more effective at infecting individuals from local host populations, even though they would be shown to be locally adapted if examined over enough generations. Contrary to expectation, parasite local adaptation was not affected by giving the parasite a longer generation time than the host, but differences in local selection intensities had a dramatic effect. }

abstract = {Developmental defects are expected to be common and severe in the early evolution of parthenogenesis, and they could help to explain the predominance of sexual forms of reproduction. It is difficult, however, to see how such defects might explain the ecological and phylogenetic correlates of sex. Here we suggest that internally fertilized animals that brood their young may be more susceptible to invasion by parthenogenetic mutants. The reason is that brooders could establish ‘selective arenas’ in which developmentally defective embryos are competitively displaced. Brooders could also selectively abort defective embryos, and replace them with minimal cost. Consistent with these ideas, we found a striking association between brooding and parthenogenesis in aquatic invertebrates. For example, in the Cnidaria and Mollusca, parthenogenesis is significantly more common in lineages that retain their young through the early stages of development. Hence brooding and ecological factors (such as escape from parasites) might combine to explain the initial spread, long-term persistence, and phylogenetic distribution of parthenogenetic reproduction. }

We also reduced plant density in field manipulations to determine whether there is any synergism between intraspecific competition and infection by the rust. The results showed no relationship between plant density and the probability of infection. However, we found that the effect of infection depends on plant density. Uninfected plants grew significantly faster than infected plants under natural conditions of high density, but infection had no significant effect on growth where density was experimentally reduced. Hence, the effect of disease on jewelweed depends on the plant's competitive environment. Such interactions between competition and disease are likely to be important to the population biology and breeding—system evolution of plants.},

abstract = {Abstract George Price showed how the effects of natural selection and environmental change could be mathematically partitioned. This partitioning may be especially useful for understanding host–parasite coevolution, where each species represents the environment for the other species. Here, we use coupled Price equations to study this kind of antagonistic coevolution. We made the common assumption that parasites must genetically match their host's genotype to avoid detection by the host's self/nonself recognition system, but we allowed for the possibility that non-matching parasites have some fitness. Our results show how natural selection on one species results in environmental change for the other species. Numerical iterations of the model show that these environmental changes can periodically exceed the changes in mean fitness due to natural selection, as suggested by R.A. Fisher. Taken together, the results give an algebraic dissection of the eco-evolutionary feedbacks created during host–parasite coevolution.},

We might thus expect to find a strong positive correlation between host genetic diversity and infection prevalence across natural populations. Here, we used computer simulations to examine host–parasite coevolution in 20 simi-isolated clonal populations across a broad range of values for both parasite virulence and parasite fecundity. We found that the correlation between host genetic diversity and infection prevalence can be significantly positive for intermediate values of parasite virulence and fecundity. But the correlation can also be weak and statistically non-significant, even when parasite-mediated frequency-dependent selection is the sole force maintaining host diversity. Hence correlational analyses of field populations, while useful, might underestimate the role of parasites in maintaining host diversity. }
