<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Plant pathogens drive density-dependent seedling mortality in a tropical tree;,citation_abstract=Abstract One explanation for the extraordinary diversity of tropical forest trees is that density-dependent mortality from herbivores or pathogens puts locally rare species at an advantage. Density-dependent mortality of seeds and small seedlings is particularly intense in tropical forests, but its causes remain uncertain. Here, we show experimentally that pathogens from the Oomycota are associated with intense mortality in seedlings of a neotropical tree, Sebastiana longicuspis. Seedlings in untreated plots experienced eight times higher mortality compared with seedlings in plots treated with fungicide. Mortality was strongly density dependent: in fungicide-treated plots survival was unaffected by density, but survival in unsprayed plots was over three times higher at low density. Density-dependent mortality observed in a simultaneous, non-manipulative study was highly transient, suggesting that short-term observational studies may underestimate the intensity and form of pathogen-induced mortality. If such effects are widespread, plant pathogens may play a key role in maintaining and structuring tropical diversity.;,citation_author=Thomas Bell;,citation_author=Robert P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=On recognising the paradox of sex;,citation_abstract=George C. Williams and John Maynard Smith arrived at slightly different conclusions about the evolutionary maintenance of sexual reproduction, despite that both were staunch neo-Darwinians, simply because they approached the problem from different angles (life history versus population genetics). This difference between their perspectives made them notice the so-called paradox of sexual reproduction for the first time. That is, Williams and Maynard Smith used their difference in perspective constructively, in order to raise a problem that had previously been overlooked by ?monocular? views. Evidence from before, during and after the recognition of the paradox supports this thesis of constructive difference. First, Maynard Smith had diagnosed the individual cost of sexual reproduction in full detail by 1958, but nobody raised an eyebrow for a decade. Second, both the correspondence between Williams and Maynard Smith and their publications show that they saw the same problem but against different backgrounds, because they viewed it from different perspectives. Third, further differences between Williams and Maynard Smith concerning the evolution of sex make no sense except in the light of the initial difference in their perspectives.;,citation_author=Joachim Dagg;,citation_publication_date=2016;,citation_cover_date=2016;,citation_year=2016;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.3998/ptb.6959004.0008.003;,citation_volume=8;,citation_journal_title=Philosophy, Theory, and Practice in Biology;,citation_publisher=Michigan Publishing, University of Michigan Library;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Uncovering the genomic basis of infection through co-genomic sequencing of hosts and parasites;,citation_abstract=Understanding the genomic basis of infectious disease is a fundamental objective in co-evolutionary theory with relevance to healthcare, agriculture, and epidemiology. Models of host-parasite co-evolution often assume that infection requires specific combinations of host and parasite genotypes. Co-evolving host and parasite loci are, therefore, expected to show associations that reflect an underlying infection/resistance allele matrix, yet little evidence for such genome-to-genome interactions has been observed among natural populations. We conducted a study to search for this genomic signature across 258 linked host (Daphnia magna) and parasite (Pasteuria ramosa) genomes. Our results show a clear signal of genomic association between multiple epistatically interacting loci in the host genome, and a family of genes encoding for collagen-like protein in the parasite genome. These findings are supported by laboratory-based infection trials, which show strong correspondence between phenotype and genotype at the identified loci. Our study provides clear genomic evidence of antagonistic co-evolution among wild populations.;,citation_author=Eric Dexter;,citation_author=Peter D Fields;,citation_author=Dieter Ebert;,citation_publication_date=2023-06;,citation_cover_date=2023-06;,citation_year=2023;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msad145;,citation_issue=7;,citation_doi=10.1093/molbev/msad145;,citation_issn=1537-1719;,citation_volume=40;,citation_journal_title=Molecular Biology and Evolution;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Viruses and the advantage of sex in &amp;amp;amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Anthoxanthum odoratum&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;: A review;,citation_abstract=Abstract The nature of the selective forces responsible for the maintenance of sexual reproduction in populations remains controversial. Theoreticians have proposed a variety of mechanisms to explain how sex is adaptive, including varying environments, sib competition, mutational damage, and pathogens. In a well-studied population of the short-lived, perennial grass Anthoxanthum odoratum in a mown North Carolina field, significant fitness advantages for sexual versus asexual offspring have been shown. Evidence from two recent experiments implicates barley yellow dwarf luteovirus (BYDV), a single-stranded RNA virus, as a cause of the short-term advantage for sex in this population. When planted in sites close to parents, asexual offspring were twice as frequently infected as sexual offspring. In other sites, infection was more frequent among common than rare genotypes. Viruses possess a unique combination of features which make them plausible candidates to favor sexual reproduction in plants. Viruses are pervasive, have subtle but significant fitness effects, have the potential for rapid mutation and evolution, and are spread by vectors whose behaviors are host frequency dependent. The ecological and evolutionary consequences of viruses in plant populations deserve further study.;,citation_author=Steven E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Viral pathogens and the advantage of sex in the perennial grass &amp;amp;amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Anthoxanthum odoratum&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;;,citation_abstract=The ubiquity of sexual reproduction among plants and animals remains one of the major unresolved paradoxes of modern evolutionary biology. In order for sex to be maintained in populations, sex must confer immediate and substantial fitness benefits. Theoreticians have proposed numerous mechanisms to explain how such advantages arise, but experimental data are few. In one well-studied population of the perennial grass Anthoxanthum odoratum in a mown North Carolina field, sexual offspring have been found to have significantly higher fitness than asexual offspring. More recent field experiments show that an aphid-transmitted virus, barley yellow dwarf (BYDV)-strain SGV, specifically transmitted by Schizaphus graminum, frequently infects Anthoxanthum progeny soon after transplantation into the field, BYDV infection is asymptomatic in Anthoxanthum, but BYDV-inoculated clones planted directly in the field had significantly lower fitness than healthy controls. Sexual females have been hypothesized to gain a fitness advantage for their offspring in the presence of pathogens either by providing ‘an escape in time’ from pathogens preadapted to the parental genotype or through the production of rare genotypes, which escape frequency-dependent infection. When parental clones and seed-derived sexual offspring were planted in identical but separate arrays in sites near where the parent was collected, parental clones were twice as frequently infected as sexual offspring. Factors other than genetic variation may have contributed to differences in levels of infection between sexual and asexual progeny: in this experiment, clonally derived asexual offspring tillers were slightly larger than seed-derived sexual tillers; in field experiments, larger plants were more frequently infected than smaller plants. When different families were planted into a common site, there was evidence that genotypes were less frequently infected when locally rare than when common. Taken together, the data suggest that BYDV infection generates advantages for rare or sexually produced genotypes in Anthoxanthum. The pattern of infection is likely to result from a complex interaction between vector, host, and viral genetics and population structure, vector behaviour, and host and vector dispersal patterns. Sexually produced genotypes appear to benefit because they are both novel and rare, but the observed minority advantage was weak. Other viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens in this Anthoxanthum population may act as frequency-dependent selective forces in different places in the field, collectively generating the substantial and observed overall fitness advantage of rare genotypes. Further study is needed to elucidate their role. Nevertheless, the data do show that viral pathogens, which are often asymptomatic, play a significant evolutionary role in plant populations.;,citation_author=Steven E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Migration, virulence, and the geographic mosaic of adaptation by parasites.;,citation_abstract=The geographic mosaic theory of coevolution is predicated on structured populations of interacting species where gene flow and the force of selection can vary among populations, leading to a mosaic of traits in space. Here, I briefly review some recent studies of adaptation by a sterilizing parasite to structured populations of a freshwater snail. The results show geographic structure as expected under the geographic mosaic model. I then consider the effects of virulence and migration on local adaptation by parasites using a computer simulation. The results suggest that high virulence and low migration contribute to the strength of local adaptation by parasites. Highly virulent parasites showed adaptation to local hosts for migration rates of up to 10% of the population per generation. In addition, because of the dynamic nature of host‐parasite coevolution, the magnitude of local adaptation fluctuates over time. During some points in the cycle, parasites may be no more effective at infecting individuals from local host populations, even though they would be shown to be locally adapted if examined over enough generations. Contrary to expectation, parasite local adaptation was not affected by giving the parasite a longer generation time than the host, but differences in local selection intensities had a dramatic effect.;,citation_author=C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Brooding and the evolution of parthenogenesis: Strategy models and evidence from aquatic invertebrates;,citation_abstract=Developmental defects are expected to be common and severe in the early evolution of parthenogenesis, and they could help to explain the predominance of sexual forms of reproduction. It is difficult, however, to see how such defects might explain the ecological and phylogenetic correlates of sex. Here we suggest that internally fertilized animals that brood their young may be more susceptible to invasion by parthenogenetic mutants. The reason is that brooders could establish ‘selective arenas’ in which developmentally defective embryos are competitively displaced. Brooders could also selectively abort defective embryos, and replace them with minimal cost. Consistent with these ideas, we found a striking association between brooding and parthenogenesis in aquatic invertebrates. For example, in the Cnidaria and Mollusca, parthenogenesis is significantly more common in lineages that retain their young through the early stages of development. Hence brooding and ecological factors (such as escape from parasites) might combine to explain the initial spread, long-term persistence, and phylogenetic distribution of parthenogenetic reproduction.;,citation_author=Curtis M.

We also reduced plant density in field manipulations to determine whether there is any synergism between intraspecific competition and infection by the rust. The results showed no relationship between plant density and the probability of infection. However, we found that the effect of infection depends on plant density. Uninfected plants grew significantly faster than infected plants under natural conditions of high density, but infection had no significant effect on growth where density was experimentally reduced. Hence, the effect of disease on jewelweed depends on the plant’s competitive environment.

This partitioning may be especially useful for understanding host–parasite coevolution, where each species represents the environment for the other species. Here, we use coupled Price equations to study this kind of antagonistic coevolution. We made the common assumption that parasites must genetically match their host’s genotype to avoid detection by the host’s self/nonself recognition system, but we allowed for the possibility that non-matching parasites have some fitness. Our results show how natural selection on one species results in environmental change for the other species. Numerical iterations of the model show that these environmental changes can periodically exceed the changes in mean fitness due to natural selection, as suggested by R.A. Fisher.

Here, we used computer simulations to examine host–parasite coevolution in 20 simi-isolated clonal populations across a broad range of values for both parasite virulence and parasite fecundity. We found that the correlation between host genetic diversity and infection prevalence can be significantly positive for intermediate values of parasite virulence and fecundity. But the correlation can also be weak and statistically non-significant, even when parasite-mediated frequency-dependent selection is the sole force maintaining host diversity. Hence correlational analyses of field populations, while useful, might underestimate the role of parasites in maintaining host diversity.;,citation_author=Curtis M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The coevolution of parasites with host-acquired immunity and the evolution of sex;,citation_abstract=Here I present a deterministic model of the coevolution of parasites with the acquired immunity of their hosts, a system in which coevolutionary oscillations can be maintained. These dynamics can confer an advantage to sexual reproduction within the parasite population, but the effect is not strong enough to outweigh the twofold cost of sex. The advantage arises primarily because sexual reproduction impedes the response to fluctuating epistasis and not because it facilitates the response to directional selection—in fact, sexual reproduction often slows the response to directional selection. Where the cost of sexual reproduction is small, a polymorphism can be maintained between the sexuals and the asexuals. A polymorphism is maintained in which the advantage gained due to recombination is balanced by the cost of sex. At much higher costs of sex, a polymorphism between the asexual and sexual populations can still be maintained if the asexuals do not have a full complement of genotypes available to them, because the asexuals only outcompete those sexuals with which they share the same selected alleles. However, over time we might expect the asexuals to amass the full array of genotypes, thus permanently eliminating sexuals from the population. The sexuals may avoid this fate if the parasite population is finite. Although the model presented here describes the coevolution of parasites with the acquired immune responses of their hosts, it can be compared with other host‐parasite models that have more traditionally been used to investigate Red Queen theories of the evolution of sex.;,citation_author=Katrina A.

Stream order and productivity influenced frequencies of these fish, and local habitat patchiness contributed strongly to spatial segregation. The magnitude and direction of local segregation was unaffected by striking seasonal variation in one stream. For the second stream, the relative contributions of local, geographical, and seasonal components of spatial variation were assessed through estimation of variance components. Spatial segregation at the smallest scale accounted for the largest proportion of variance in the distribution of species and clones.;,citation_author=Russell A. Schenck;,citation_author=Robert C.

<p>In 1988, Indiana University advertised for an assistant professor in population biology with emphasis on disease ecology. Lynda and I both applied. Happily, we were offered a split position in Biology in which we each got half salary. It may not sound like a good deal, but we were thrilled. It is not easy for a dual-career couple in the same field. We relocated to Bloomington in January 1990, arriving during a cold snap (-20° C). We moved into a university house, but we did not know enough to have the electricity turned on before arrival. Luckily, we still had our down sleeping bags, which we had purchased for field work in the Southern Alps. Aside from the chilly start, moving to Bloomington was the beginning of an academic dream come true.</p>

<h2 data-number="6.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-problem"><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> The Problem</h2>
<p>Since the beginning of my work on sex/asex, there were two things that worried me about the Red Queen Hypothesis. The first of these was pointed out by May and Anderson <span class="citation" data-cites="may1983a">(<a href="references.html#ref-may1983a" role="doc-biblioref">1983</a>)</span>. This 1983 paper is the same incredible study that launched the wave of studies on the evolution of parasite virulence, but it was also one of the first simulation studies of the Red Queen Hypothesis for sex. May and Anderson concluded that the Red Queen could work, but only if parasites killed their hosts (i.e., they were maximally virulent).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> So, it seemed to me that the Red Queen could not be a general explanation for sex. It was for this reason that I was biased against the hypothesis when I first started my work in New Zealand. But as May and Anderson pointed out, their model made assumptions that were <q>not brought down from Mt. Sinai.</q> They assumed, in particular, that infection was mediated by a single locus with two alleles, giving three genotypes. They also assumed that the clonal population was initiated with all three possible genotypes for resistance. These are critical assumptions, as we will see in Part Two <span class="citation" data-cites="lively2018a">(or see <a href="references.html#ref-lively2018a" role="doc-biblioref">Lively 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The second problem was that parasites do not select for sex per se. They only select against common genotypes. This means that once parasites drive a common clone down to a rare frequency, it should become favored by selection. Barring loss of the clone by chance in small populations, the clone should increase in frequency, eventually leading to oscillations over time. So, while parasites might prevent the fixation of the clone in the short term, they do not eliminate it. Now here is the problem. What if a second clone, with a different genotype, arises in the population? It should also spread when rare. So should any new clone. Given that parasites are simply a source of frequency-dependent selection, parasite-mediated selection should lead to the accumulation of different clonal genotypes <span class="citation" data-cites="lively1994a">(<a href="references.html#ref-lively1994a" role="doc-biblioref">Lively &amp; Howard 1994</a>)</span>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> It seemed obvious that, if clonal diversity became sufficiently high, the diverse clonal population would eliminate the sexual population. Hence the Red Queen did not seem stable in the face of repeated mutation to asexual reproduction. I began to think that combining alternative hypotheses might be useful. I turned first to Muller’s ratchet.</p>

<h2 data-number="6.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mullers-ratchet"><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Muller’s Ratchet</h2>
<p>Herman J. Muller was a prize-winning geneticist. He won the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology just one year after moving to Indiana University in 1945. In the early 1960s, Muller was invited to write an introductory paper for a new journal. The editor made an effort to acknowledge Muller in the preface to this first issue <span class="citation" data-cites="sobels1964a">(<a href="references.html#ref-sobels1964a" role="doc-biblioref">Sobels 1964</a>)</span>: <q>We are particularly honored that we can start the journal with a paper by Dr.&nbsp;H. J. Muller.</q> In this inaugural paper, Muller wrote a bomb sentence <span class="citation" data-cites="muller1964a">(<a href="references.html#ref-muller1964a" role="doc-biblioref">1964</a>)</span>: <q>[w]e find that an asexual population incorporates a kind of ratchet mechanism, such that it can never get to contain, in any of its lines, a load of mutations smaller than that already existing in its at present least-loaded lines.</q> In other words, obligately asexual populations should accumulate deleterious mutations over time. A decade later, Joe Felsenstein named the idea <q>Muller’s ratchet</q> <span class="citation" data-cites="felsenstein1974a">(<a href="references.html#ref-felsenstein1974a" role="doc-biblioref">1974</a>)</span>, and he pointed to the probable importance of the ratchet in population genetics.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> The concepts underlying the idea are not especially intuitive, but I will try to explain the gist of it. First, we must ask, what is a clone?</p>
<p>I have been using <q>clone</q> so far to describe a group of genetically identical descendants from a single asexual individual. But Muller knew that this was not strictly true because mutation happens. Thus, as any new clone spreads in a population, mutations accumulate, leading to variation among individuals in the number of mutations (<a href="#fig-6-1" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>6.1</span></a>). It must be true then that there is a group of individuals within the clone that have the fewest mutations. Muller called this the <q>least-loaded class.</q> Here is Muller’s insight. Given that the least-loaded class in a finite population might be a handful of individuals, the least-loaded (most fit) class could be lost by chance. How would that happen? Two ways. First, the members of the least-loaded class (<q>LLC</q>) could be lost by bad luck. Maybe all five of members of the LLC were washed away by a flood, or anything related to being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Second, the members of the LLC might produce offspring with one (or more) new mutations. Clearly, the two options are not mutually exclusive. The point is the least-loaded class can be lost. This means that the ratchet clicks towards a greater mean number of mutations in an asexual line.</p>
<p>My students will immediately engage, <q>Okay, but the most-loaded class could also be lost for the same reason.</q> Yes, that is correct. But the most-loaded class can be restored by new mutations in the second most-loaded class. In contrast, the LLC can only be restored by back mutation, which has a very low probability of occurrence. Hence, the mean number of mutations in a clonal lineage is expected to increase over time, thereby decreasing mean fitness and eroding the advantage to asexual reproduction.</p>
<p>The ratchet, however, takes a long time to work, especially in large populations where genetic drift is less problematic. As such, a clone would likely outcompete and eliminate the coexisting sexual population before the ratchet drives the clone to extinction. Hence, Muller’s ratchet does not seem to be a viable stand-alone explanation for the persistence of obligately sexual populations. But what if there were a force that periodically reduced the number of clonal individuals? That should increase the rate of mutation accumulation by genetic drift in the asexual lineage. Hopefully, you can see where this is going.</p>

<h2 data-number="6.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="synergistic-ideas-the-ratchet-and-the-red-queen"><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Synergistic Ideas? The Ratchet and the Red Queen</h2>
<p>Here is the idea. Parasite-mediated selection against common genotypes might prevent the fixation of a clone in the short term. Parasites could also drive clones through periodic bottlenecks, which would speed up the rate at which the ratchet clicks. The ratchet could then gradually reduce the reproductive advantage of asexual reproduction. Eventually the clone would be eliminated, not by parasites, but by a parasite-driven ratchet. Perhaps the ratchet could eliminate different clonal lineages as quickly as they were generated by mutation in the sexual population.</p>
<p>My first PhD student at Indiana University was Steve Howard, who transferred in from another lab. Early on, we had many discussions about our experiences as construction workers and our fondness for characters in John Steinbeck’s books. We also began to expand on the possibility of synergism between the ratchet and the Red Queen. During one of our sessions, Steve (in a whimsical moment) said that he could have a solution in the morning. But it was not an overnight problem to solve, as we both soon realized. The solution required an individual-based computer simulation, which was not common at that time <span class="citation" data-cites="judson1994a">(<a href="references.html#ref-judson1994a" role="doc-biblioref">Judson 1994</a>)</span>. By that I mean that Steve had to write a simulation that kept track of every individual in the population, including whether it became infected, and whether it produced offspring with one or more new mutations. Steve is a locked-on theoretician. He could not sleep during the construction of his model, and he would sometimes call me in the middle of the night. First, he had to show that the model would converge on analytical solutions for the number of mutations at equilibrium. This equilibrium is called <q>mutation-selection balance,</q> which occurs when the input of mutations is exactly cancelled out by the elimination of mutations by natural selection (<a href="#sec-app-6" class="quarto-xref"><span>Section&nbsp;6.5</span></a>). But what is the analytical solution?</p>
<p>As in any model, there are assumptions involved. For starters, let’s assume that the proportional reduction in fitness caused by each new mutation is the same as for all previous mutations (independent effects). Therefore, the fitness of an individual with <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> mutations is given by <span class="math inline">\((1-s)^k\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> gives the selection against each mutation. Kimura and Maruyama <span class="citation" data-cites="kimura1966a">(<a href="references.html#ref-kimura1966a" role="doc-biblioref">1966</a>)</span> showed that the number of mutations at mutation-selection balance is equal to <span class="math inline">\(U/s\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is the expected number of new mutations in offspring. Further, they showed that mean fitness at mutation-selection balance is equal to <span class="math inline">\(e^{-U}\)</span>, assuming that selection is weak (<a href="#fig-6-1" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>6.1</span></a>). Following Kimura and Maruyama’s results, John Haigh showed further that the number of individuals in the least-loaded class (<span class="math inline">\(n_0\)</span>) at mutation-selection balance is: <span class="math inline">\(n_0=Ne^{-U/s}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the total population size <span class="citation" data-cites="haigh1978a">(<a href="references.html#ref-haigh1978a" role="doc-biblioref">Haigh 1978</a>)</span>. Keep in mind that the number of individuals in the least-loaded class (<span class="math inline">\(n_0\)</span>) is an especially important value, because the smaller the number, the easier it is to lose it by drift, resulting in one click of the ratchet. Haigh also showed that, once the ratchet clicks, the original (Poisson) distribution of mutations is reset, where the mean of the distribution is increased by one (<a href="#fig-6-2" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>6.2</span></a>). Critically, Haigh’s result suggests that <span class="math inline">\(n_0\)</span> can be fewer than 10 individuals, even for very large population sizes. The ratchet seems unavoidable.</p>

<p>Happily, Steve’s simulation converged on the analytically derived values for the mean number of mutations and the mean fitness at mutation-selection balance. Now for the more difficult part. Does host-parasite coevolution accelerate the accumulation of mutations in clonal lineages? Does the combination of the ratchet and the Red Queen lead to extinction of the clone before it eliminates its sexual competitors? Note that the simulation made the conservative assumption that infected individuals in the most-loaded class had the same fitness as infected individuals in the LLC. In other words, infection was not more severe in individuals having more mutations.</p>
<p>Steve’s simulations showed that, in the absence of parasites, an initially rare clone went to fixation in fewer than 50 generations, thereby driving the sexual population extinct <span class="citation" data-cites="howard1994a">(<a href="references.html#ref-howard1994a" role="doc-biblioref">Howard &amp; Lively 1994b</a>)</span>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> However, after about 500 generations, the clone also went extinct due to the accumulation of mutations via the ratchet. Hence, the ratchet was sufficient to take out the clone, but not before the clone replaced the entire sexual population. In the presence of parasites, but without the ratchet, the clone also rapidly replaced the sexual subpopulation, and the clone’s descendants remained at carrying capacity for the duration of the simulation (<a href="#fig-6-3" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>6.3</span></a>).</p>

<p>By contrast, when parasites were combined with the ratchet, sexual reproduction was initially invaded by the clone, but the clone did not replace the sexuals. How does that work? The clone was initiated with a small number of individuals (<span class="math inline">\(N = 20\)</span>) at mutation-selection balance. The clone then increased when rare, but as the clone spread in the population, the ratchet was already working to reduce the two-fold cost of males (see <a href="why-sex.html" class="quarto-xref"><span>Chapter&nbsp;1</span></a>). In addition, as the clone became common, the parasite population rapidly evolved to infect it. This combination of the ratchet and parasite-mediated frequency-dependent selection prevented the clone from fixing in the short term. The clone then began to oscillate in frequency over time. But every time the clone was driven to low frequency, the number of individuals in the LLC decreased, thereby allowing for a more rapid operation of the ratchet. Notably, over the period of several oscillations, the clone tended to be driven to lower frequencies each time. So as the ratchet erodes the cost of males, the clone was driven to a lower frequency during successive oscillations, which fed back to fuel the ratchet. The clone is toast. Eventually the clone undergoes a mutational meltdown and goes extinct <span class="citation" data-cites="lynch1990a">(<a href="references.html#ref-lynch1990a" role="doc-biblioref">Lynch &amp; Gabriel 1990</a>)</span>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> This example provides a proof of concept that host-parasite coevolution can work in a synergistic way with Muller’s ratchet to prevent fixation of the clone in the short term (&lt;20 generations) and to ensure the elimination of the clone in the longer term.</p>
<p>To get a better feeling of the parameter space over which the ratchet and the Red Queen could work to select for sex over the long term, Steve explored different combinations of mutation rate, selection against mutation, parasite virulence, and parasite transmission. In the absence of mutation, the results showed that sexual reproduction was evolutionarily stable only when parasites were both extremely virulent and highly transmissible (<a href="#fig-6-4" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>6.4</span></a>). This result was consistent with the model of May and Anderson <span class="citation" data-cites="may1983a">(<a href="references.html#ref-may1983a" role="doc-biblioref">1983</a>)</span>. Sexuals and asexuals coexisted where parasite virulence and transmission were both high, but not at maximum values (<a href="#fig-6-4" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>6.4</span></a>). Finally, asexual reproduction replaced sexual reproduction when parasites had low levels of virulence and/or transmission.</p>

<p>Now, what if we add in mutation? Steve’s results suggested that for genome-wide mutation rates of <span class="math inline">\(U = 0.5\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(1.0\)</span>, sexual reproduction was stable to replacement by asexual reproduction, even when parasites <strong>were only moderately virulent</strong>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> This surprised us! One of the major difficulties for the Red Queen had been that May and Anderson’s <span class="citation" data-cites="may1983a">(<a href="references.html#ref-may1983a" role="doc-biblioref">1983</a>)</span> results suggest that parasites had to kill or sterilize infected hosts to provide sufficiently strong selection for cross-fertilization.

When we started out, we had not imagined that the synergism between the ratchet and the Red Queen could be so powerful.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>The potential for synergism between antagonistic coevolution and mutation accumulation later became the subject of a target review in 1999, headed up by Stuart West <span class="citation" data-cites="west1999a">(<a href="references.html#ref-west1999a" role="doc-biblioref">1999</a>)</span>. Stu was a post-doc in Andrew Read’s lab in Edinburgh while I was there as a sabbatical visitor in the lab. But the whole thing originally started at a meeting we all attended at the Max Planck Institute in Seewiesen, Germany. It was an amazing gathering on the evolution of sex, organized by Nico Michiels, with an incredible mix of faculty, post-docs, and students. I presented some of the snail data along with the results of Howard and Lively <span class="citation" data-cites="howard1994a">(<a href="references.html#ref-howard1994a" role="doc-biblioref">1994b</a>)</span> to a rather mixed reaction. To my mind, it seemed that the students and post-docs (including Stu) liked the idea of combining hypotheses, but at least one of the more established members in the field saw it as an attempt by hippies to make everyone happy.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> In any case, Stu expanded on the basic idea back in Edinburgh, and he convinced Andrew and me to help him craft it as a target review for the <em>Journal of Evolutionary Biology</em>. I was very reluctant, as several key researchers in the field would be asked to publish their thoughts on the matter, which I knew were unlikely to be uniformly positive. In the end, our paper was published—along with over a dozen commentaries (see <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/14209101/1999/12/6">vol.&nbsp;12, issue 6</a>). The commentaries were more positive on average than I expected, but mainly it was interesting to see the diversity of thought by some of the top biologists studying sex and recombination at the time.</p>
<p>My work with Steve Howard on synergism between the ratchet and the Red Queen led me to rethink my views on Strong Inference, as discussed in <a href="eco-hyp-cont.html" class="quarto-xref"><span>Chapter&nbsp;3</span></a>, where the goal is to force competing hypotheses to make different predictions before getting the data. But what if the answer is some combination, or even synergism, between hypotheses? It could be that forcing predictions could result in the rejection of all alternatives, when in fact two or more hypotheses were partially true. And if two hypotheses are strongly synergistic, would it be appropriate to claim that one was more important? In studying this problem, I found an excellent article contrasting Platt’s strong inference with Chamberlin’s method of multiple working hypotheses <span class="citation" data-cites="elliott2007a">(<a href="references.html#ref-elliott2007a" role="doc-biblioref">Elliott &amp; Brook 2007</a>)</span>. Elliott and Brook state that the two methods are often treated as the same idea (of which I was guilty in <a href="eco-hyp-cont.html" class="quarto-xref"><span>Chapter&nbsp;3</span></a>). But they are not the same. Platt’s paper (which drew heavily from Chamberlin) focused on designing programs that would falsify all but one of the alternatives, whereas Chamberlin allowed for combinations, and even synergism, between competing hypotheses. It now seems to me that Chamberlin’s original <span class="citation" data-cites="chamberlin1890a">(<a href="references.html#ref-chamberlin1890a" role="doc-biblioref">1890</a>)</span> paper better describes the best way forward with respect to the problem of sex.</p>

<h3 data-number="6.3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-about-parasites"><span class="header-section-number">6.3.1</span> What about parasites?</h3>
<p>One of the major patterns of sex/asex was pointed out by Graham Bell. He found that parasitic species were much more likely to be outcrossing than their free-living relatives <span class="citation" data-cites="bell1982a">(<a href="references.html#ref-bell1982a" role="doc-biblioref">Bell 1982</a>)</span>. This finding was emphatically supported by a formal phylogenetic study of free-living versus parasitic nematodes <span class="citation" data-cites="gibson2015a">(<a href="references.html#ref-gibson2015a" role="doc-biblioref">Gibson &amp; Fuentes 2015</a>)</span>. However, much of the theoretical focus for sex/asex has focused on hosts. What about parasites? If host-parasite coevolution can contribute to selection for sexual reproduction in hosts, does it also feedback to select for sex in parasites? If so, is it sufficient? Steve Howard was one of the first theoreticians to address these questions along with Alison Galvani and Katrina Lythgoe <span class="citation" data-cites="lythgoe2000a galvani2003a">(<a href="references.html#ref-galvani2003a" role="doc-biblioref">Galvani <em>et al.</em> 2003</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-lythgoe2000a" role="doc-biblioref">Lythgoe 2000</a>)</span>. Steve’s results showed that sexual populations of obligate parasites could be invaded and replaced by a diverse population of clonal parasite genotypes. More specifically, repeated mutation to asexual reproduction in the parasite population led to a diverse clonal population, which eventually replaced the ancestral sexual population. However, the ratchet, in combination with Red Queen dynamics, could lead to the elimination of clones and the long-term maintenance of sexual parasite populations <span class="citation" data-cites="howard2002a">(<a href="references.html#ref-howard2002a" role="doc-biblioref">Howard &amp; Lively 2002</a>)</span>. Hence, the results for parasites mirror those found for hosts, except that the ratchet worked more rapidly in obligate parasites, as selection is stronger, giving rise to more extreme oscillations during Red Queen dynamics. It is still unknown whether the ratchet and the Red Queen work synergistically to select for sex in either parasites or hosts.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> But it seems like a sensible possibility, especially where both host and parasite genetic diversity is very high, host populations are finite, and parasites rarely coinfect the same host individual. It is also possible, of course, that neither coevolution nor mutation accumulation is required. More empirical and theoretical work is required.</p>

<p>Suppose the probability of a new mutation in offspring is <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span>. Clearly, it would not make sense to say that every offspring acquires one half of one mutation. But it would make sense to say that offspring have a Poisson distribution of new mutations. Under a Poisson distribution, the frequency of individuals with <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> new mutations is given by <span class="math display">\[f_k=\frac{e^{-U}U^k}{k!}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is the probability of a new mutation per generation. Under this formulation, the frequency of offspring that contain no new mutations is given by <span class="math display">\[f_0=e^{-U}.\]</span></p>
<p>Suppose a clonal population begins with a single individual with zero mutations (<span class="math inline">\(k = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w_0 = 1\)</span>). As above, let all future offspring acquire an average of <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> additional mutations per generation. The lineage would gain mutations over time, until the input of mutations is equal to the loss of mutations due to selection. At this point in time, the clonal population is at mutation-selection balance. Kimura and Maruyama <span class="citation" data-cites="kimura1966a">(<a href="references.html#ref-kimura1966a" role="doc-biblioref">1966</a>)</span> showed that the average number of mutations in a clonal lineage at mutation-selection balance is equal to <span class="math inline">\(U/s\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is the selection coefficient against each mutation. They also showed that the mean fitness at this balance (assuming that <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is small) is <span class="math display">\[\hat{w}=e^{-U}.\]</span> Hence, population mean fitness at equilibrium is expected to be equal to the expected frequency of zero new mutations in offspring.</p>
<p>In an infinite population, we would expect the mean fitness to remain at this equilibrium value. But populations are finite, which leads to Muller’s ratchet. John Haigh constructed the first model to deeply explore the ratchet <span class="citation" data-cites="haigh1978a">(<a href="references.html#ref-haigh1978a" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a>)</span>. He first assumed that each deleterious mutation results in the same proportional reduction in fitness as all previous mutations. Let <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> be the selection coefficient against each mutation. Under Haigh’s assumption, an individual with zero mutations would have a relative fitness of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, while an individual with one mutation would have a relative fitness of <span class="math inline">\((1-s)\)</span>, and an individual with two mutations would have a relative fitness of <span class="math inline">\((1-s)(1-s)\)</span>. More generally, an individual with <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> mutations would have a relative fitness of <span class="math display">\[w_k=(1-s)^k.\]</span> Haigh assumed that the number of <em>individuals</em> having <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> mutations <span class="math inline">\((n_k)\)</span> at mutation-selection balance also follow a Poisson distribution, such that <span class="math display">\[n_k=\frac{n_0\left(\frac{U}{s}\right)^k}{k!}.\]</span> In this expression, <span class="math inline">\(n_0\)</span> is the number of individuals with zero mutations, which is the least-loaded class. How many individuals in the least-loaded class? Let <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> be the total number of individuals in the clonal population. Under a Poisson distribution for mutational load, the number of individuals in the least-loaded class is <span class="math display">\[n_0=Ne^{-U/s}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(e^{-U/s}\)</span> is the frequency of individuals in the zero class. This means that the LLC can be quite small, even in large clonal populations. For example, let <span class="math inline">\(N = 100,000\)</span>, let <span class="math inline">\(s = 0.02\)</span>, and let <span class="math inline">\(U = 0.2\)</span>. Plugging these values into the solution for <span class="math inline">\(n_0\)</span> we find that only five individuals would be in the LLC at mutation-selection balance. Such a small group is at risk of loss by genetic drift.</p>
<p>Haigh ran simulations to study the loss of the LLC, and the effect of this loss on the distribution of mutational classes. He found that following the loss of the LLC, the entire distribution shifted to a greater mean number of mutations, but the shape of the distribution remained constant. Hence, after one click of the ratchet, the LLC still had about five individuals, but now the LLC had one additional mutation. The mean number of mutations had also increased by one.</p>

<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5"></a>In 1988, Indiana University advertised for an assistant professor in population biology with emphasis on disease ecology. Lynda and I both applied. Happily, we were offered a split position in Biology in which we each got half salary. It may not sound like a good deal, but we were thrilled. It is not easy for a dual-career couple in the same field. We relocated to Bloomington in January 1990, arriving during a cold snap (-20<span class="dv">&amp;deg;</span> C). We moved into a university house, but we did not know enough to have the electricity turned on before arrival. Luckily, we still had our down sleeping bags, which we had purchased for field work in the Southern Alps.

<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7"></a><span class="fu">## The Problem </span></span>
<span id="cb1-8"><a href="#cb1-8"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-9"><a href="#cb1-9"></a>Since the beginning of my work on sex/asex, there were two things that worried me about the Red Queen Hypothesis. The first of these was pointed out by May and Anderson <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">-@may1983a</span><span class="co">]</span>. This 1983 paper is the same incredible study that launched the wave of studies on the evolution of parasite virulence, but it was also one of the first simulation studies of the Red Queen Hypothesis for sex. May and Anderson concluded that the Red Queen could work, but only if parasites killed their hosts (i.e., they were maximally virulent).^<span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">May and Anderson, for example, state, "Our studies, in which the epidemiological details of the parasite–host interactions are treated more explicitly than in Hamilton's work, make this [the parasite] answer to the problem of sex [@ghiselin1974a; @williams1975a; @maynard1978a] less likely."</span><span class="co">]</span> So, it seemed to me that the Red Queen could not be a general explanation for sex. It was for this reason that I was biased against the hypothesis when I first started my work in New Zealand. But as May and Anderson pointed out, their model made assumptions that were "not brought down from Mt. Sinai." They assumed, in particular, that infection was mediated by a single locus with two alleles, giving three genotypes. They also assumed that the clonal population was initiated with all three possible genotypes for resistance. These are critical assumptions, as we will see in Part Two <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">or see @lively2018a</span><span class="co">]</span>. </span>
<span id="cb1-10"><a href="#cb1-10"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-11"><a href="#cb1-11"></a>The second problem was that parasites do not select for sex per se. They only select against common genotypes. This means that once parasites drive a common clone down to a rare frequency, it should become favored by selection. Barring loss of the clone by chance in small populations, the clone should increase in frequency, eventually leading to oscillations over time. So, while parasites might prevent the fixation of the clone in the short term, they do not eliminate it. Now here is the problem. What if a second clone, with a different genotype, arises in the population? It should also spread when rare. So should any new clone. Given that parasites are simply a source of frequency-dependent selection, parasite-mediated selection should lead to the accumulation of different clonal genotypes <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@lively1994a</span><span class="co">]</span>.^<span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">In a computer simulation, a sexual population with eight possible genotypes (three locus haploid model with two alleles each) was rapidly replaced by two randomly selected clonal genotypes. The first clone was introduced at time one, and it began oscillating with the sexual population. The second clone was introduced at time 100. It began oscillating out of phase with the first clone. The sexual population was driven to extinction by generation 150 [@lively1994a]. Thus, sexual reproduction may not be stable to invasion and replacement by a diverse clonal population.</span><span class="co">]</span> It seemed obvious that, if clonal diversity became sufficiently high, the diverse clonal population would eliminate the sexual population. Hence the Red Queen did not seem stable in the face of repeated mutation to asexual reproduction. I began to think that combining alternative hypotheses might be useful. I turned first to Muller's ratchet.</span>

<span id="cb1-13"><a href="#cb1-13"></a><span class="fu">## Muller's Ratchet</span></span>
<span id="cb1-14"><a href="#cb1-14"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-15"><a href="#cb1-15"></a>Herman J. Muller was a prize-winning geneticist. He won the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology just one year after moving to Indiana University in 1945. In the early 1960s, Muller was invited to write an introductory paper for a new journal. The editor made an effort to acknowledge Muller in the preface to this first issue <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@sobels1964a</span><span class="co">]</span>: "We are particularly honored that we can start the journal with a paper by Dr. H. J. Muller." In this inaugural paper, Muller wrote a bomb sentence <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">-@muller1964a</span><span class="co">]</span>: "<span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">w</span><span class="co">]</span>e find that an asexual population incorporates a kind of ratchet mechanism, such that it can never get to contain, in any of its lines, a load of mutations smaller than that already existing in its at present least-loaded lines." In other words, obligately asexual populations should accumulate deleterious mutations over time. A decade later, Joe Felsenstein named the idea "Muller's ratchet" <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">-@felsenstein1974a</span><span class="co">]</span>, and he pointed to the probable importance of the ratchet in population genetics.^<span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">From Felsenstein [-@felsenstein1974a]: "I will not attempt here to predict from theory the quantitative effect of the ratchet mechanism. Involving natural selection, mutation, and genetic drift at many linked loci, the problem poses enormous difficulties for the application of population genetics theory. But the possible significance of the phenomenon makes it important that some theoretical treatment should be attempted. The ratchet mechanism has been unjustly ignored by theoretical population genetics."</span><span class="co">]</span> The concepts underlying the idea are not especially intuitive, but I will try to explain the gist of it. First, we must ask, what is a clone?</span>
<span id="cb1-16"><a href="#cb1-16"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-17"><a href="#cb1-17"></a>I have been using "clone" so far to describe a group of genetically identical descendants from a single asexual individual. But Muller knew that this was not strictly true because mutation happens. Thus, as any new clone spreads in a population, mutations accumulate, leading to variation among individuals in the number of mutations (@fig-6-1). It must be true then that there is a group of individuals within the clone that have the fewest mutations. Muller called this the "least-loaded class." Here is Muller's insight. Given that the least-loaded class in a finite population might be a handful of individuals, the least-loaded (most fit) class could be lost by chance. How would that happen? Two ways. First, the members of the least-loaded class ("LLC") could be lost by bad luck. Maybe all five of members of the LLC were washed away by a flood, or anything related to being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Second, the members of the LLC might produce offspring with one (or more) new mutations. Clearly, the two options are not mutually exclusive. The point is the least-loaded class can be lost. This means that the ratchet clicks towards a greater mean number of mutations in an asexual line. </span>
<span id="cb1-18"><a href="#cb1-18"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-19"><a href="#cb1-19"></a>My students will immediately engage, "Okay, but the most-loaded class could also be lost for the same reason." Yes, that is correct. But the most-loaded class can be restored by new mutations in the second most-loaded class. In contrast, the LLC can only be restored by back mutation, which has a very low probability of occurrence. Hence, the mean number of mutations in a clonal lineage is expected to increase over time, thereby decreasing mean fitness and eroding the advantage to asexual reproduction. </span>
<span id="cb1-20"><a href="#cb1-20"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-21"><a href="#cb1-21"></a>The ratchet, however, takes a long time to work, especially in large populations where genetic drift is less problematic. As such, a clone would likely outcompete and eliminate the coexisting sexual population before the ratchet drives the clone to extinction. Hence, Muller's ratchet does not seem to be a viable stand-alone explanation for the persistence of obligately sexual populations. But what if there were a force that periodically reduced the number of clonal individuals? That should increase the rate of mutation accumulation by genetic drift in the asexual lineage. Hopefully, you can see where this is going. </span>
<span id="cb1-22"><a href="#cb1-22"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-23"><a href="#cb1-23"></a><span class="fu">## Synergistic Ideas? The Ratchet and the Red Queen</span></span>
<span id="cb1-24"><a href="#cb1-24"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-25"><a href="#cb1-25"></a>Here is the idea. Parasite-mediated selection against common genotypes might prevent the fixation of a clone in the short term. Parasites could also drive clones through periodic bottlenecks, which would speed up the rate at which the ratchet clicks. The ratchet could then gradually reduce the reproductive advantage of asexual reproduction. Eventually the clone would be eliminated, not by parasites, but by a parasite-driven ratchet. Perhaps the ratchet could eliminate different clonal lineages as quickly as they were generated by mutation in the sexual population. </span>
<span id="cb1-26"><a href="#cb1-26"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-27"><a href="#cb1-27"></a>My first PhD student at Indiana University was Steve Howard, who transferred in from another lab. Early on, we had many discussions about our experiences as construction workers and our fondness for characters in John Steinbeck's books. We also began to expand on the possibility of synergism between the ratchet and the Red Queen. During one of our sessions, Steve (in a whimsical moment) said that he could have a solution in the morning. But it was not an overnight problem to solve, as we both soon realized. The solution required an individual-based computer simulation, which was not common at that time <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@judson1994a</span><span class="co">]</span>. By that I mean that Steve had to write a simulation that kept track of every individual in the population, including whether it became infected, and whether it produced offspring with one or more new mutations. Steve is a locked-on theoretician. He could not sleep during the construction of his model, and he would sometimes call me in the middle of the night. First, he had to show that the model would converge on analytical solutions for the number of mutations at equilibrium. This equilibrium is called "mutation-selection balance," which occurs when the input of mutations is exactly cancelled out by the elimination of mutations by natural selection (@sec-app-6). But what is the analytical solution?</span>
<span id="cb1-28"><a href="#cb1-28"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-29"><a href="#cb1-29"></a>As in any model, there are assumptions involved. For starters, let's assume that the proportional reduction in fitness caused by each new mutation is the same as for all previous mutations (independent effects). Therefore, the fitness of an individual with $k$ mutations is given by $(1-s)^k$ where $s$ gives the selection against each mutation. Kimura and Maruyama <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">-@kimura1966a</span><span class="co">]</span> showed that the number of mutations at mutation-selection balance is equal to $U/s$, where $U$ is the expected number of new mutations in offspring. Further, they showed that mean fitness at mutation-selection balance is equal to $e^{-U}$, assuming that selection is weak (@fig-6-1). Following Kimura and Maruyama's results, John Haigh showed further that the number of individuals in the least-loaded class ($n_0$) at mutation-selection balance is: $n_0=Ne^{-U/s}$ where $N$ is the total population size <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@haigh1978a</span><span class="co">]</span>. Keep in mind that the number of individuals in the least-loaded class ($n_0$) is an especially important value, because the smaller the number, the easier it is to lose it by drift, resulting in one click of the ratchet. Haigh also showed that, once the ratchet clicks, the original (Poisson) distribution of mutations is reset, where the mean of the distribution is increased by one (@fig-6-2). Critically, Haigh's result suggests that $n_0$ can be fewer than 10 individuals, even for very large population sizes. The ratchet seems unavoidable.</span>

<span id="cb1-34"><a href="#cb1-34"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-35"><a href="#cb1-35"></a>Happily, Steve's simulation converged on the analytically derived values for the mean number of mutations and the mean fitness at mutation-selection balance. Now for the more difficult part. Does host-parasite coevolution accelerate the accumulation of mutations in clonal lineages? Does the combination of the ratchet and the Red Queen lead to extinction of the clone before it eliminates its sexual competitors? Note that the simulation made the conservative assumption that infected individuals in the most-loaded class had the same fitness as infected individuals in the LLC. In other words, infection was not more severe in individuals having more mutations. </span>
<span id="cb1-36"><a href="#cb1-36"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-37"><a href="#cb1-37"></a>Steve's simulations showed that, in the absence of parasites, an initially rare clone went to fixation in fewer than 50 generations, thereby driving the sexual population extinct <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@howard1994a</span><span class="co">]</span>.^<span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">After the proofs were corrected and returned, the shading was washed out in Figures 1 and 2. Even worse, the panels were reversed for Figure 3. The corrected figures were reprinted in Howard and Lively [-@howard1994b].</span><span class="co">]</span> However, after about 500 generations, the clone also went extinct due to the accumulation of mutations via the ratchet. Hence, the ratchet was sufficient to take out the clone, but not before the clone replaced the entire sexual population. In the presence of parasites, but without the ratchet, the clone also rapidly replaced the sexual subpopulation, and the clone's descendants remained at carrying capacity for the duration of the simulation (@fig-6-3). </span>

The green line shows a simulation for hosts infected with coevolving parasites, but in the absence of deleterious mutations. Virulence and transmission were both moderate ($= 0.5$). Under these conditions, the sexual hosts were eliminated by the clone. The blue line shows a case without parasites in which mutations occur with a probability of 0.5 per genome per generation $(U = 0.5)$, and selection against mutation is $s = 0.025$. Again, the clone goes to fixation, but it is later eliminated by Muller's ratchet. The red line shows a case where both mutations and coevolving parasites were included. Here, the clone did not replace the sexual population but rather oscillated in frequency, which led to more rapid mutation accumulation and elimination of the clone.

<span id="cb1-40"><a href="#cb1-40"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-41"><a href="#cb1-41"></a>By contrast, when parasites were combined with the ratchet, sexual reproduction was initially invaded by the clone, but the clone did not replace the sexuals. How does that work? The clone was initiated with a small number of individuals ($N = 20$) at mutation-selection balance. The clone then increased when rare, but as the clone spread in the population, the ratchet was already working to reduce the two-fold cost of males (see @sec-why-sex). In addition, as the clone became common, the parasite population rapidly evolved to infect it. This combination of the ratchet and parasite-mediated frequency-dependent selection prevented the clone from fixing in the short term. The clone then began to oscillate in frequency over time. But every time the clone was driven to low frequency, the number of individuals in the LLC decreased, thereby allowing for a more rapid operation of the ratchet. Notably, over the period of several oscillations, the clone tended to be driven to lower frequencies each time. So as the ratchet erodes the cost of males, the clone was driven to a lower frequency during successive oscillations, which fed back to fuel the ratchet. The clone is toast. Eventually the clone undergoes a mutational meltdown and goes extinct <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@lynch1990a</span><span class="co">]</span>.^<span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Mutational meltdown in clones occurs when their intrinsic birth rates are near one, meaning that the females are just barely replacing themselves. This then keeps the clonal population small, which also keeps the least-loaded class small, thereby aiding the ratchet. Once the intrinsic birth rate drops below one, the clone will go extinct.</span><span class="co">]</span> This example provides a proof of concept that host-parasite coevolution can work in a synergistic way with Muller's ratchet to prevent fixation of the clone in the short term (&lt;20 generations) and to ensure the elimination of the clone in the longer term. </span>
<span id="cb1-42"><a href="#cb1-42"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-43"><a href="#cb1-43"></a>To get a better feeling of the parameter space over which the ratchet and the Red Queen could work to select for sex over the long term, Steve explored different combinations of mutation rate, selection against mutation, parasite virulence, and parasite transmission. In the absence of mutation, the results showed that sexual reproduction was evolutionarily stable only when parasites were both extremely virulent and highly transmissible (@fig-6-4). This result was consistent with the model of May and Anderson <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">-@may1983a</span><span class="co">]</span>. Sexuals and asexuals coexisted where parasite virulence and transmission were both high, but not at maximum values (@fig-6-4). Finally, asexual reproduction replaced sexual reproduction when parasites had low levels of virulence and/or transmission. </span>

Note that sexual reproduction only wins outright when virulence is at or near its maximum value of one and transmission is also very high.

<span id="cb1-46"><a href="#cb1-46"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-47"><a href="#cb1-47"></a>Now, what if we add in mutation? Steve's results suggested that for genome-wide mutation rates of $U = 0.5$ to $1.0$, sexual reproduction was stable to replacement by asexual reproduction, even when parasites **were only moderately virulent**.^<span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">"Virulence" is defined here as the effect that infection has on host fitness. For example, a virulence value of 1.0 indicates that infection kills or sterilizes the host. A virulence of 0.1 indicates that infection reduces host fitness by 10%.</span><span class="co">]</span> This surprised us! One of the major difficulties for the Red Queen had been that May and Anderson's <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">-@may1983a</span><span class="co">]</span> results suggest that parasites had to kill or sterilize infected hosts to provide sufficiently strong selection for cross-fertilization. Steve's new results suggested that, in combination with the ratchet, parasites did have to generate such strong selection against infected individuals (@fig-6-5). When we started out, we had not imagined that the synergism between the ratchet and the Red Queen could be so powerful.^<span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Steve followed this initial study with a simulation study of mutation accumulation in a Red Queen world but changing the assumption from independent effects of mutations to synergistic effects of mutations [@howard1998a].

<span id="cb1-51"><a href="#cb1-51"></a>The potential for synergism between antagonistic coevolution and mutation accumulation later became the subject of a target review in 1999, headed up by Stuart West <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">-@west1999a</span><span class="co">]</span>. Stu was a post-doc in Andrew Read's lab in Edinburgh while I was there as a sabbatical visitor in the lab. But the whole thing originally started at a meeting we all attended at the Max Planck Institute in Seewiesen, Germany. It was an amazing gathering on the evolution of sex, organized by Nico Michiels, with an incredible mix of faculty, post-docs, and students. I presented some of the snail data along with the results of Howard and Lively <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">-@howard1994a</span><span class="co">]</span> to a rather mixed reaction. To my mind, it seemed that the students and post-docs (including Stu) liked the idea of combining hypotheses, but at least one of the more established members in the field saw it as an attempt by hippies to make everyone happy.^<span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">I heard this kind of thing called "group-hug pluralism" at a meeting of philosophers in Berlin in 2022. In any case, our fusion of the ratchet and the Red Queen was based on logic rather than any sort of craving for hugs.</span><span class="co">]</span> In any case, Stu expanded on the basic idea back in Edinburgh, and he convinced Andrew and me to help him craft it as a target review for the *Journal of Evolutionary Biology*. I was very reluctant, as several key researchers in the field would be asked to publish their thoughts on the matter, which I knew were unlikely to be uniformly positive. In the end, our paper was published<span class="dv">&amp;#8212;</span>along with over a dozen commentaries (see <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">vol. 12, issue 6</span><span class="co">](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/14209101/1999/12/6)</span>). The commentaries were more positive on average than I expected, but mainly it was interesting to see the diversity of thought by some of the top biologists studying sex and recombination at the time. </span>
<span id="cb1-52"><a href="#cb1-52"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-53"><a href="#cb1-53"></a>My work with Steve Howard on synergism between the ratchet and the Red Queen led me to rethink my views on Strong Inference, as discussed in @sec-eco-hyp-cont, where the goal is to force competing hypotheses to make different predictions before getting the data. But what if the answer is some combination, or even synergism, between hypotheses? It could be that forcing predictions could result in the rejection of all alternatives, when in fact two or more hypotheses were partially true. And if two hypotheses are strongly synergistic, would it be appropriate to claim that one was more important?  In studying this problem, I found an excellent article contrasting Platt's strong inference with Chamberlin's method of multiple working hypotheses <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@elliott2007a</span><span class="co">]</span>. Elliott and Brook state that the two methods are often treated as the same idea (of which I was guilty in @sec-eco-hyp-cont). But they are not the same. Platt's paper (which drew heavily from Chamberlin) focused on designing programs that would falsify all but one of the alternatives, whereas Chamberlin allowed for combinations, and even synergism, between competing hypotheses. It now seems to me that Chamberlin's original <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">-@chamberlin1890a</span><span class="co">]</span> paper better describes the best way forward with respect to the problem of sex. </span>
<span id="cb1-54"><a href="#cb1-54"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-55"><a href="#cb1-55"></a><span class="fu">### What about parasites?</span></span>
<span id="cb1-56"><a href="#cb1-56"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-57"><a href="#cb1-57"></a>One of the major patterns of sex/asex was pointed out by Graham Bell. He found that parasitic species were much more likely to be outcrossing than their free-living relatives <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@bell1982a</span><span class="co">]</span>. This finding was emphatically supported by a formal phylogenetic study of free-living versus parasitic nematodes <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@gibson2015a</span><span class="co">]</span>. However, much of the theoretical focus for sex/asex has focused on hosts. What about parasites? If host-parasite coevolution can contribute to selection for sexual reproduction in hosts, does it also feedback to select for sex in parasites? If so, is it sufficient? Steve Howard was one of the first theoreticians to address these questions along with Alison Galvani and Katrina Lythgoe <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@lythgoe2000a; @galvani2003a</span><span class="co">]</span>. Steve's results showed that sexual populations of obligate parasites could be invaded and replaced by a diverse population of clonal parasite genotypes. More specifically, repeated mutation to asexual reproduction in the parasite population led to a diverse clonal population, which eventually replaced the ancestral sexual population. However, the ratchet, in combination with Red Queen dynamics, could lead to the elimination of clones and the long-term maintenance of sexual parasite populations <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@howard2002a</span><span class="co">]</span>. Hence, the results for parasites mirror those found for hosts, except that the ratchet worked more rapidly in obligate parasites, as selection is stronger, giving rise to more extreme oscillations during Red Queen dynamics. It is still unknown whether the ratchet and the Red Queen work synergistically to select for sex in either parasites or hosts.^<span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Professor Hamilton told me at a meeting in London that he thought combining the ratchet and the Red Queen made sense, but that he did not think the ratchet was a necessary addition. See also the dissertation work by Olivia Judson for a detailed theoretical study of coexistence between sexuals and asexuals in a metapopulation [@judson1997a].</span><span class="co">]</span> But it seems like a sensible possibility, especially where both host and parasite genetic diversity is very high, host populations are finite, and parasites rarely coinfect the same host individual. It is also possible, of course, that neither coevolution nor mutation accumulation is required. More empirical and theoretical work is required. </span>

<span id="cb1-71"><a href="#cb1-71"></a>Suppose the probability of a new mutation in offspring is $0.5$. Clearly, it would not make sense to say that every offspring acquires one half of one mutation. But it would make sense to say that offspring have a Poisson distribution of new mutations. Under a Poisson distribution, the frequency of individuals with $k$ new mutations is given by $$f_k=\frac{e^{-U}U^k}{k!}$$ where $U$ is the probability of a new mutation per generation. Under this formulation, the frequency of offspring that contain no new mutations is given by $$f_0=e^{-U}.$$</span>
<span id="cb1-72"><a href="#cb1-72"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-73"><a href="#cb1-73"></a>Suppose a clonal population begins with a single individual with zero mutations ($k = 0$ and $w_0 = 1$). As above, let all future offspring acquire an average of $U$ additional mutations per generation. The lineage would gain mutations over time, until the input of mutations is equal to the loss of mutations due to selection. At this point in time, the clonal population is at mutation-selection balance. Kimura and Maruyama <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">-@kimura1966a</span><span class="co">]</span> showed that the average number of mutations in a clonal lineage at mutation-selection balance is equal to $U/s$, where $s$ is the selection coefficient against each mutation. They also showed that the mean fitness at this balance (assuming that $s$ is small) is $$\hat{w}=e^{-U}.$$ Hence, population mean fitness at equilibrium is expected to be equal to the expected frequency of zero new mutations in offspring. </span>
<span id="cb1-74"><a href="#cb1-74"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-75"><a href="#cb1-75"></a>In an infinite population, we would expect the mean fitness to remain at this equilibrium value. But populations are finite, which leads to Muller's ratchet. John Haigh constructed the first model to deeply explore the ratchet <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">-@haigh1978a</span><span class="co">]</span>. He first assumed that each deleterious mutation results in the same proportional reduction in fitness as all previous mutations. Let $s$ be the selection coefficient against each mutation. Under Haigh's assumption, an individual with zero mutations would have a relative fitness of $1$, while an individual with one mutation would have a relative fitness of $(1-s)$, and an individual with two mutations would have a relative fitness of $(1-s)(1-s)$. More generally, an individual with $k$ mutations would have a relative fitness of $$w_k=(1-s)^k.$$ Haigh assumed that the number of *individuals* having $k$ mutations $(n_k)$ at mutation-selection balance also follow a Poisson distribution, such that $$n_k=\frac{n_0\left(\frac{U}{s}\right)^k}{k!}.$$ In this expression, $n_0$ is the number of individuals with zero mutations, which is the least-loaded class. How many individuals in the least-loaded class? Let $N$ be the total number of individuals in the clonal population. Under a Poisson distribution for mutational load, the number of individuals in the least-loaded class is $$n_0=Ne^{-U/s}$$ where $e^{-U/s}$ is the frequency of individuals in the zero class. This means that the LLC can be quite small, even in large clonal populations. For example, let $N = 100,000$, let $s = 0.02$, and let $U = 0.2$. Plugging these values into the solution for $n_0$ we find that only five individuals would be in the LLC at mutation-selection balance. Such a small group is at risk of loss by genetic drift.</span>
<span id="cb1-76"><a href="#cb1-76"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-77"><a href="#cb1-77"></a>Haigh ran simulations to study the loss of the LLC, and the effect of this loss on the distribution of mutational classes. He found that following the loss of the LLC, the entire distribution shifted to a greater mean number of mutations, but the shape of the distribution remained constant. Hence, after one click of the ratchet, the LLC still had about five individuals, but now the LLC had one additional mutation. The mean number of mutations had also increased by one. </span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
