<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Plant pathogens drive density-dependent seedling mortality in a tropical tree;,citation_abstract=Abstract One explanation for the extraordinary diversity of tropical forest trees is that density-dependent mortality from herbivores or pathogens puts locally rare species at an advantage. Density-dependent mortality of seeds and small seedlings is particularly intense in tropical forests, but its causes remain uncertain. Here, we show experimentally that pathogens from the Oomycota are associated with intense mortality in seedlings of a neotropical tree, Sebastiana longicuspis. Seedlings in untreated plots experienced eight times higher mortality compared with seedlings in plots treated with fungicide. Mortality was strongly density dependent: in fungicide-treated plots survival was unaffected by density, but survival in unsprayed plots was over three times higher at low density. Density-dependent mortality observed in a simultaneous, non-manipulative study was highly transient, suggesting that short-term observational studies may underestimate the intensity and form of pathogen-induced mortality. If such effects are widespread, plant pathogens may play a key role in maintaining and structuring tropical diversity.;,citation_author=Thomas Bell;,citation_author=Robert P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=On recognising the paradox of sex;,citation_abstract=George C. Williams and John Maynard Smith arrived at slightly different conclusions about the evolutionary maintenance of sexual reproduction, despite that both were staunch neo-Darwinians, simply because they approached the problem from different angles (life history vs. population genetics). This difference between their perspectives made them notice the so-called paradox of sexual reproduction for the first time. That is, Williams and Maynard Smith used their difference in perspective constructively, in order to raise a problem that had previously been overlooked by ?monocular? views. Evidence from before, during and after the recognition of the paradox supports this thesis of constructive difference. First, Maynard Smith had diagnosed the individual cost of sexual reproduction in full detail by 1958, but nobody raised an eyebrow for a decade. Second, both the correspondence between Williams and Maynard Smith and their publications show that they saw the same problem but against different backgrounds, because they viewed it from different perspectives. Third, further differences between Williams and Maynard Smith concerning the evolution of sex make no sense except in the light of the initial difference in their perspectives.;,citation_author=Joachim Dagg;,citation_publication_date=2016;,citation_cover_date=2016;,citation_year=2016;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.3998/ptb.6959004.0008.003;,citation_volume=8;,citation_journal_title=Philosophy, Theory, and Practice in Biology;,citation_publisher=Michigan Publishing, University of Michigan Library;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Uncovering the genomic basis of infection through co-genomic sequencing of hosts and parasites;,citation_abstract=Understanding the genomic basis of infectious disease is a fundamental objective in co-evolutionary theory with relevance to healthcare, agriculture, and epidemiology. Models of host-parasite co-evolution often assume that infection requires specific combinations of host and parasite genotypes. Co-evolving host and parasite loci are, therefore, expected to show associations that reflect an underlying infection/resistance allele matrix, yet little evidence for such genome-to-genome interactions has been observed among natural populations. We conducted a study to search for this genomic signature across 258 linked host (Daphnia magna) and parasite (Pasteuria ramosa) genomes. Our results show a clear signal of genomic association between multiple epistatically interacting loci in the host genome, and a family of genes encoding for collagen-like protein in the parasite genome. These findings are supported by laboratory-based infection trials, which show strong correspondence between phenotype and genotype at the identified loci. Our study provides clear genomic evidence of antagonistic co-evolution among wild populations.;,citation_author=Eric Dexter;,citation_author=Peter D Fields;,citation_author=Dieter Ebert;,citation_publication_date=2023-06;,citation_cover_date=2023-06;,citation_year=2023;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msad145;,citation_issue=7;,citation_doi=10.1093/molbev/msad145;,citation_issn=1537-1719;,citation_volume=40;,citation_journal_title=Molecular Biology and Evolution;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Viruses and the advantage of sex in &amp;amp;amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Anthoxanthum odoratum&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;: A review;,citation_abstract=Abstract The nature of the selective forces responsible for the maintenance of sexual reproduction in populations remains controversial. Theoreticians have proposed a variety of mechanisms to explain how sex is adaptive, including varying environments, sib competition, mutational damage, and pathogens. In a well-studied population of the short-lived, perennial grass Anthoxanthum odoratum in a mown North Carolina field, significant fitness advantages for sexual vs. asexual offspring have been shown. Evidence from two recent experiments implicates barley yellow dwarf luteovirus (BYDV), a single-stranded RNA virus, as a cause of the short-term advantage for sex in this population. When planted in sites close to parents, asexual offspring were twice as frequently infected as sexual offspring. In other sites, infection was more frequent among common than rare genotypes. Viruses possess a unique combination of features which make them plausible candidates to favor sexual reproduction in plants. Viruses are pervasive, have subtle but significant fitness effects, have the potential for rapid mutation and evolution, and are spread by vectors whose behaviors are host frequency dependent. The ecological and evolutionary consequences of viruses in plant populations deserve further study.;,citation_author=Steven E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Viral pathogens and the advantage of sex in the perennial grass &amp;amp;amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Anthoxanthum odoratum&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;;,citation_abstract=The ubiquity of sexual reproduction among plants and animals remains one of the major unresolved paradoxes of modern evolutionary biology. In order for sex to be maintained in populations, sex must confer immediate and substantial fitness benefits. Theoreticians have proposed numerous mechanisms to explain how such advantages arise, but experimental data are few. In one well-studied population of the perennial grass Anthoxanthum odoratum in a mown North Carolina field, sexual offspring have been found to have significantly higher fitness than asexual offspring. More recent field experiments show that an aphid-transmitted virus, barley yellow dwarf (BYDV)-strain SGV, specifically transmitted by Schizaphus graminum, frequently infects Anthoxanthum progeny soon after transplantation into the field, BYDV infection is asymptomatic in Anthoxanthum, but BYDV-inoculated clones planted directly in the field had significantly lower fitness than healthy controls. Sexual females have been hypothesized to gain a fitness advantage for their offspring in the presence of pathogens either by providing “an escape in time” from pathogens preadapted to the parental genotype or through the production of rare genotypes, which escape frequency-dependent infection. When parental clones and seed-derived sexual offspring were planted in identical but separate arrays in sites near where the parent was collected, parental clones were twice as frequently infected as sexual offspring. Factors other than genetic variation may have contributed to differences in levels of infection between sexual and asexual progeny: in this experiment, clonally derived asexual offspring tillers were slightly larger than seed-derived sexual tillers; in field experiments, larger plants were more frequently infected than smaller plants. When different families were planted into a common site, there was evidence that genotypes were less frequently infected when locally rare than when common. Taken together, the data suggest that BYDV infection generates advantages for rare or sexually produced genotypes in Anthoxanthum. The pattern of infection is likely to result from a complex interaction between vector, host, and viral genetics and population structure, vector behaviour, and host and vector dispersal patterns. Sexually produced genotypes appear to benefit because they are both novel and rare, but the observed minority advantage was weak. Other viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens in this Anthoxanthum population may act as frequency-dependent selective forces in different places in the field, collectively generating the substantial and observed overall fitness advantage of rare genotypes. Further study is needed to elucidate their role. Nevertheless, the data do show that viral pathogens, which are often asymptomatic, play a significant evolutionary role in plant populations.;,citation_author=Steven E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Migration, virulence, and the geographic mosaic of adaptation by parasites.;,citation_abstract=The geographic mosaic theory of coevolution is predicated on structured populations of interacting species where gene flow and the force of selection can vary among populations, leading to a mosaic of traits in space. Here, I briefly review some recent studies of adaptation by a sterilizing parasite to structured populations of a freshwater snail. The results show geographic structure as expected under the geographic mosaic model. I then consider the effects of virulence and migration on local adaptation by parasites using a computer simulation. The results suggest that high virulence and low migration contribute to the strength of local adaptation by parasites. Highly virulent parasites showed adaptation to local hosts for migration rates of up to 10% of the population per generation. In addition, because of the dynamic nature of host‐parasite coevolution, the magnitude of local adaptation fluctuates over time. During some points in the cycle, parasites may be no more effective at infecting individuals from local host populations, even though they would be shown to be locally adapted if examined over enough generations. Contrary to expectation, parasite local adaptation was not affected by giving the parasite a longer generation time than the host, but differences in local selection intensities had a dramatic effect.;,citation_author=C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Brooding and the evolution of parthenogenesis: Strategy models and evidence from aquatic invertebrates;,citation_abstract=Developmental defects are expected to be common and severe in the early evolution of parthenogenesis, and they could help to explain the predominance of sexual forms of reproduction. It is difficult, however, to see how such defects might explain the ecological and phylogenetic correlates of sex. Here we suggest that internally fertilized animals that brood their young may be more susceptible to invasion by parthenogenetic mutants. The reason is that brooders could establish “selective arenas” in which developmentally defective embryos are competitively displaced. Brooders could also selectively abort defective embryos, and replace them with minimal cost. Consistent with these ideas, we found a striking association between brooding and parthenogenesis in aquatic invertebrates. For example, in the Cnidaria and Mollusca, parthenogenesis is significantly more common in lineages that retain their young through the early stages of development. Hence brooding and ecological factors (such as escape from parasites) might combine to explain the initial spread, long-term persistence, and phylogenetic distribution of parthenogenetic reproduction.;,citation_author=Curtis M.

We also reduced plant density in field manipulations to determine whether there is any synergism between intraspecific competition and infection by the rust. The results showed no relationship between plant density and the probability of infection. However, we found that the effect of infection depends on plant density. Uninfected plants grew significantly faster than infected plants under natural conditions of high density, but infection had no significant effect on growth where density was experimentally reduced. Hence, the effect of disease on jewelweed depends on the plant’s competitive environment. Such interactions between competition and disease are likely to be important to the population biology and breeding—system evolution of plants.;,citation_author=Curtis M.

This partitioning may be especially useful for understanding host–parasite coevolution, where each species represents the environment for the other species. Here, we use coupled Price equations to study this kind of antagonistic coevolution. We made the common assumption that parasites must genetically match their host’s genotype to avoid detection by the host’s self/nonself recognition system, but we allowed for the possibility that non-matching parasites have some fitness. Our results show how natural selection on one species results in environmental change for the other species. Numerical iterations of the model show that these environmental changes can periodically exceed the changes in mean fitness due to natural selection, as suggested by R.A. Fisher. Taken together, the results give an algebraic dissection of the eco-evolutionary feedbacks created during host–parasite coevolution.;,citation_author=Curtis M. Lively;,citation_author=Michael J.

Here, we used computer simulations to examine host–parasite coevolution in 20 simi-isolated clonal populations across a broad range of values for both parasite virulence and parasite fecundity. We found that the correlation between host genetic diversity and infection prevalence can be significantly positive for intermediate values of parasite virulence and fecundity. But the correlation can also be weak and statistically non-significant, even when parasite-mediated frequency-dependent selection is the sole force maintaining host diversity. Hence correlational analyses of field populations, while useful, might underestimate the role of parasites in maintaining host diversity.;,citation_author=Curtis M.

Stream order and productivity influenced frequencies of these fish, and local habitat patchiness contributed strongly to spatial segregation. The magnitude and direction of local segregation was unaffected by striking seasonal variation in one stream. For the second stream, the relative contributions of local, geographical, and seasonal components of spatial variation were assessed through estimation of variance components. Spatial segregation at the smallest scale accounted for the largest proportion of variance in the distribution of species and clones.;,citation_author=Russell A. Schenck;,citation_author=Robert C.

<p>The sex/recombination (“sex/rec”) anomaly has attracted some of the best theoretical biologists over the last 50 years leading to at least two dozen hypotheses to explain selection for recombination and/or the persistence of obligate sexual reproduction in natural populations <span class="citation" data-cites="kondrashov1993a">(<a href="references.html#ref-kondrashov1993a" role="doc-biblioref">Kondrashov 1993</a>)</span>. In what follows, I first focus on the ecological hypotheses. The ideas underlying these hypotheses provide a handle for understanding some of the foundational concepts in evolutionary ecology.</p>
<section id="the-lottery-model" class="level2" data-number="2.1">
<h2 data-number="2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-lottery-model"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> The Lottery Model</h2>
<p>As part of his book on the evolution of sex, Williams <span class="citation" data-cites="williams1975a">(<a href="references.html#ref-williams1975a" role="doc-biblioref">1975</a>)</span> suggests that sex could be favored in fluctuating abiotic environments. The idea is intuitive: cross-fertilization generates variation among offspring. Hence, in fluctuating environments, sex could increase the probability that some offspring might survive. Williams likens the idea to a unique kind of lottery. For example, he writes, “Suppose you were offered this choice in a lottery: either you could have several different tickets, or you could have the same number of copies of the same ticket” (p.&nbsp;15). If you choose <em>N</em> copies of the same ticket (asex) and your ticket wins, you get <em>N</em> times the reward. If you choose <em>N</em> different tickets (sex), you increase the probability of winning something, but the reward is smaller. Williams refers to the idea as the aphid-rotifer model, but the idea has since come to be known as the Lottery Model <span class="citation" data-cites="bell1982a">(following <a href="references.html#ref-bell1982a" role="doc-biblioref">Bell 1982</a>)</span>, which is a more descriptive phrase.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>In my evolution course, I ask a form of Williams’ question but with a slight twist:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If you had a garden, upon which your descendants will depend for many generations to come, would you</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>plant a genetically variable crop, or</li>
<li>a monoculture with a two-fold higher yield?</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep in mind that your descendants will follow your choice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Often the students rightfully want some clarification. They ask, for example, “Can we use pesticides?” But every time, most students choose the variable crop. I remind them that selecting the variable crop will reduce their yield by one half. They don’t budge. I re-ask the question, doubling the relative yield for the monoculture from two-fold to four-fold. Then to 10-fold. Occasionally, one of the more risk-prone students will select the 10-fold higher yield, but most do not budge. They want genetic variation. I ask them why. Invariably, they say that the environment is going to change. They want to hedge their bets against an uncertain future.</p>
<p>Indeed, Williams’ Lottery Model is about bet hedging. The gist of bet hedging in evolutionary theory is that selection can act to reduce the variance in reproductive success over time, even if it also reduces the arithmetic mean across years <span class="citation" data-cites="philippi1989a">(review in <a href="references.html#ref-philippi1989a" role="doc-biblioref">Philippi &amp; Seger 1989</a>)</span>. Suppose, for example, that we have the following data for both a monoculture and a genetically variable polyculture (in arbitrary units). Let’s assume that the variation in yield is driven by annual variation in abiotic factors such as temperature or precipitation. The effect of planting a polyculture (bet-hedging) can be estimated from the geometric mean, which incorporates the variation in yield over time.</p>

<p>In this example, we find that the monoculture has an arithmetic mean of 240, while the polyculture has an arithmetic mean of only 220. So, I might be inclined to plant the monoculture. However, the among-year variance is very high for the monoculture (relative to the polyculture), driven in large part by the low yields in years 4 and 5. By contrast, the geometric mean for the monoculture is 184, while the geometric mean for the polyculture is 219. Based on this, I might be inclined to plant the polyculture, as it reduces the cost of very low yield in bad years. I think the students see this intuitively. Over the long term, it is better to be risk-averse and plant the genetically variable polyculture. What if, for example, the monoculture produced no food in the last year? The geometric mean would be zero. That would be catastrophic.</p>
<p>The effect of variance on the geometric mean (GM) can be seen by an approximation <span class="citation" data-cites="stearns2000a">(<a href="references.html#ref-stearns2000a" role="doc-biblioref">Stearns 2000</a>)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{GM} \approx \overline{x} - \frac{\text{var}(x)}{2\overline{x}}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\overline{x}\)</span> is the mean, and var(<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>) is the variance in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Note that the approximation is equal to the arithmetic mean when the variance in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is zero. Note too that the geometric mean increases as the variance in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> decreases. So, if selection operates to reduce the among-year variance in fitness, the outcome of selection will be reflected by an increase in the geometric mean. In general, evolutionary biologists use the geometric mean (rather than the arithmetic mean) to measure fitness over time.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Can sex be favored in variable environments as a bet-hedging strategy? It seems like a very sensible idea provided that the production of genetically variable progeny reduces the among-year variance in offspring survival. But remember, under a two-fold cost of sex, asexuals can replace large populations of sexuals in tens of generations (see <a href="why-sex.html" class="quarto-xref"><span>Chapter&nbsp;1</span></a>). So, if the Lottery Model is correct, significant environmental change must occur very rapidly. The many thousands of years between ice ages, for example, would be too long.</p>

<h2 data-number="2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-niche"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> The Tangled Bank / Frozen Niche-Variation Model</h2>
<p>Roughly speaking, the Lottery Model concerns the value of producing diverse offspring in a temporally variable abiotic environment. A different kind of model instead concerns the role of competition for different resource types that vary in space. Let us first consider the Frozen Niche-Variation Hypothesis of Robert Vrijenhoek. The key idea is that the clonal derivatives of sexual ancestors “freeze” some of the genetic variation in the sexual population. This frozen genotype then determines the resource niche of the clone. It seems reasonable to assume that the niche width of a single clone would be relatively narrow compared to the niche width of the genetically diverse sexual population. So, under this idea, a clone could invade a sexual population and perhaps displace it from one of its many niches. But a single clone could not completely replace the sexual population <span class="citation" data-cites="vrijenhoek1979a">(<a href="references.html#ref-vrijenhoek1979a" role="doc-biblioref">Vrijenhoek 1979</a>)</span>. This kind of process could explain those situations in which sexual and asexual females coexist, which was a major advance.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>A conceptually similar model was independently developed by Graham Bell: the Tangled Bank Hypothesis <span class="citation" data-cites="bell1982a">(<a href="references.html#ref-bell1982a" role="doc-biblioref">1982</a>)</span>. Bell nabbed the name from the last paragraph of the <em>Origin of Species</em>, in which Darwin imagines life as an “entangled bank” of species interacting in a complex network. The core of the idea can be traced back to Howard Levene’s <span class="citation" data-cites="levene1953a">(<a href="references.html#ref-levene1953a" role="doc-biblioref">1953</a>)</span> pioneering model, which showed that polymorphism could be maintained in a spatially heterogeneous environment provided that different genotypes specialize on different resources. Levene’s model was a major advance, as it showed that genetic diversity could be maintained without heterozygote advantage (<a href="#sec-app-2" class="quarto-xref"><span>Section&nbsp;2.5</span></a>). This was also one of the first models to fuse population genetics with ecology. But how does multiple niche polymorphism apply to sex? The idea is that if selection results in polymorphism, then a genetically diverse sexual population might be resistant to replacement by a clonal lineage that specializes on only one of the available resource types (as also in the Frozen Niche-Variation Model).</p>
<p>Here is how I pose the Tangled Bank idea to my undergraduate students. I start by giving them a choice between two hypothetical resources, which occur in different parts of the room. One is pizza, the other is broccoli. They all choose pizza. The problem, of course, is that the per-person value of the pizza resource declines as the pizza-eating population grows. At some point, there will be an advantage to specializing on broccoli. This could lead to a polymorphic population composed of obligate pizza eaters and obligate broccoli eaters, where (at equilibrium) the value of both resources is the same. Hence, selection for or against a particular strategy depends on the frequency of that strategy in the population. Perhaps this kind of “frequency-dependent selection” could favor sexual reproduction as a way to diversify offspring in environments where different resource types are patchily distributed in space. This reasoning forms the essence of the Tangled Bank Hypothesis.</p>
<p>One especially interesting aspect of the Tangled Bank Model is that the strength of frequency-dependent selection depends on population density. For example, there would be no selection to utilize the resource of lower value (broccoli) if there were no competition for pizza. This kind of selection, where the advantage to being rare depends on population density, is sometimes referred to as “soft” selection <span class="citation" data-cites="wallace1975a">(<a href="references.html#ref-wallace1975a" role="doc-biblioref">Wallace 1975</a>)</span>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> In other words, soft selection is selection that is both frequency-dependent and density-dependent. This idea contrasts nicely with the Lottery Model, where selection is both frequency- and density-independent, which is called “hard” selection. For our purposes, we can use Wallace’s terminology to conceptually separate the Tangled Bank Hypothesis from the Lottery Model <a href="#fig-2-2" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>2.1</span></a>.</p>

</div>
<p>We can think of the contrast like this. Under the Lottery Model, changes in the environment will select against certain genotypes independent of whether they are common or rare. Selection seems unconditional (hard). Under the Tangled Bank, selection is always conditional (soft); there is an advantage to having a rare genotype, but this advantage only accrues under strong competition (high density). Soft selection may not be exactly the best possible phrase, but it contrasts nicely with hard selection.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Two caveats are worth mentioning with respect to soft selection and the Tangled Bank Hypothesis. One is that polymorphism is only stable under a narrow range of patch-types frequencies. In addition, strong tradeoffs are required for the cost and benefits for morphs occupying different patches <span class="citation" data-cites="maynard1980a lively1986a">(<a href="references.html#ref-lively1986a" role="doc-biblioref">Lively 1986</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-maynard1980a" role="doc-biblioref">Maynard Smith &amp; Hoekstra 1980</a>)</span> (see also <a href="eco-hyp-cont.html#sec-app-3" class="quarto-xref"><span>Section&nbsp;3.4</span></a>). The second caveat is that repeated mutation to asexual reproduction could lead to the accumulation of clonal diversity over time. Once all the niches are occupied by different specialized clones, there would be no advantage to sex. A diverse clonal population could then replace the sexual population <span class="citation" data-cites="bell1982a vrijenhoek2009a">(<a href="references.html#ref-bell1982a" role="doc-biblioref">Bell 1982</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-vrijenhoek2009a" role="doc-biblioref">Vrijenhoek &amp; Parker 2009</a>)</span>. This second caveat applies, in general, to any model of sex that relies on frequency-dependent selection. But the ideas could work if mutations to asex are rare. And, as I mentioned, sexuals and asexuals are known to coexist in some populations, which is consistent with the Tangled Bank and Frozen Niche-Variation Hypotheses <span class="citation" data-cites="vrijenhoek2009a">(<a href="references.html#ref-vrijenhoek2009a" role="doc-biblioref">Vrijenhoek &amp; Parker 2009</a>)</span>. Coexistence, however, is also compatible with the Red Queen hypothesis, which we will now consider.</p>

<h2 data-number="2.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-red-queen-hypothesis"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> The Red Queen Hypothesis</h2>
<p>The Red Queen Hypothesis is like the Lottery Model in that it focusses on environmental change over time. However, under the Red Queen idea, the change is mediated by changes in coevolving biological antagonists such as parasites, rather than changes in the abiotic environments.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> The distinction is important, as we will see.</p>
<p>It may be helpful to revisit <a href="why-sex.html#fig-1.2" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>1.2</span></a>, which shows the replacement of a sexual population by a clonal lineage within 25 generations. In this example, the clone is a single genotype, while the sexual population is composed of multiple recombining genotypes, only one of which is shared with the clone. Clearly, as the clone spreads, its genotype would become the most common in the host population. Now suppose that the host population is coevolving with a parasite population, which is composed of multiple strains. Assuming random contact between hosts and parasites, the parasite strain that could infect the most common host genotype would have a selective advantage over parasite strains that could only infect rare host genotypes. Let’s call this more successful parasite strain “strain <strong>A</strong>.” What would happen? It should be easy to see that strain <strong>A</strong> would increase in frequency. The parasite population would evolve.</p>
<p>Now, what if the parasite dramatically reduces the reproductive success of infected hosts? We might expect that, as the parasite evolves to infect the most-common host genotype, the reproductive advantage of the host clone is eroded. Moreover, if the parasite is <em>common and sufficiently virulent</em>, evolution by the parasite could prevent the clone from eliminating the sexual population. Under this scenario, there are at least two possible outcomes. One is that the sexuals and asexuals come to exist in stable frequencies, where the lost fecundity of the clone due to infection is equal to the cost of males, meaning that the mean fitnesses of sexuals and asexuals are equal. On the other hand, if the parasite is highly virulent, the frequencies of sexuals and asexuals can oscillate over time (<a href="#fig-2-3" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>2.2</span></a> A). Under this second scenario, the new clone initially increases, but it is driven down sharply by infection (<a href="#fig-2-3" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>2.2</span></a> B). Then, once the clone becomes very rare, it should become less infected than observed in the sexual population (<a href="#fig-2-3" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>2.2</span></a> B). During this period, there is parasite-mediated selection against sex. Hence, the clone increases in frequency (<a href="#fig-2-3" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>2.2</span></a> A), only to be driven down again by parasites after it becomes common (<a href="#fig-2-3" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>2.2</span></a> B). Another cycle begins. <strong>The key point is that parasites do not select against clonal reproduction per se; they only select against common genotypes.</strong> But selection against common host genotypes might be sufficient to prevent fixation of a clone in the short term.</p>

</div>
<p>This scenario of fluctuating selection for and against sex is just a special case of the more general idea that parasites will select against common genotypes within a diverse, sexual host population. As a rare host genotype becomes common, the parasites genotype that can infect it will be favored by natural selection. If the parasite is virulent (meaning that infection reduces host fitness), the targeted host genotype will decline in frequency, and a new host genotype will begin to increase in frequency. Under this logic, host-parasite coevolution will lead to the oscillation of genotypes in both the host and the parasite populations (<a href="#fig-2-4" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>2.3</span></a>). These oscillations are now called Red Queen dynamics. Red Queen dynamics can lead to the maintenance of genetic polymorphism in sexual populations, and possibly protect sexual reproduction from replacement by asexual lineages. In addition, Red Queen dynamics could also favor recombination within a sexual population <span class="citation" data-cites="peters1999a schmid-hempel2002a peters2007a salathe2008a">(<a href="references.html#ref-peters1999a" role="doc-biblioref">Peters &amp; Lively 1999</a>, <a href="references.html#ref-peters2007a" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-salathe2008a" role="doc-biblioref">Salathe <em>et al.</em> 2008</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-schmid-hempel2002a" role="doc-biblioref">Schmid-Hempel &amp; Jokela 2002</a>)</span>.

<p>The name for the Red Queen Hypothesis comes from <em>Through the Looking Glass</em> (Carroll 1872). Here are the relevant bits of the story. After Alice goes through the looking glass (a mirror), she decides to follow a straight path to the top of a hill. But, in following the path, she ends up at her starting point. Talking to herself, she remarks, “But how curiously it twists! It’s more like a corkscrew than a path.” Repeated attempts were unsuccessful. In frustration, Alice addresses a tiger lily amongst a patch of flowers, “I wish you could talk!” The lily informs Alice that all the flowers can talk. The stunned Alice then begins a conversation with the flowers before finally asking, “Are there any more people in the garden besides me?” The rose answers “Yes, there is someone like you.” Alice sets out to follow this person (the Red Queen), but she quickly loses sight of her, and ends up back at her original starting point. Flustered, Alice decides to follow the advice of the rose: “<em>I</em> should advise you to walk the other way.” Alice then quickly finds the Red Queen.</p>
<p>Now it gets especially interesting. Alice mentions to the Red Queen that she would like to “find my way to the top of that hill.” The Red Queen replies, “<em>I</em> could show you hills, in comparison with which you’d call that a valley.” Alice protests: “a hill <em>ca’n’t</em> be a valley…. That would be nonsense.” This exchange between Alice and the Red Queen now seems prophetic, because, under frequency-dependent selection, locations on the adaptive landscape can rapidly change from fitness peaks to fitness valleys. Perhaps the Red Queen’s statement is correct: hills can become valleys, and valleys can become hills. More specifically, genotypes that were favored by natural selection when rare can become selected against after they become common, leading to a highly dynamic adaptive landscape.</p>
<p>In any case, Alice had clearly entered a crazy world. Straight paths become like corkscrews, progress is made by going the other way, and hills become valleys. Then, suddenly, Alice and the Red Queen began to run: “Alice never could quite make out, in thinking it over afterwards, how it was that they began: all she remembers is, that they were running hand in hand, and the Queen went so fast that it was all she could do to keep up with her.” During this furious run, Alice notices that they never pass anything. The trees remain in the same place as if they were moving along with them. Alice eventually asks: “Are we nearly there?” The Red Queen replies: “Why, we passed it ten minutes ago! Faster!”</p>
<p>When they finally stop, Alice is surprised to be where they started: “I do believe we’ve been under this tree the whole time! Everything’s just as it was!” The Red Queen replies that of course, and then asks: “What would you have it?” Alice replies that she would have expected to get somewhere else after running for a long time. The Red Queen then replies with this very famous quote: “Now, <em>here</em>, you see, it takes all the running <em>you</em> can do to keep in the same place.” It is a perfect metaphor for host-parasite coevolution.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> Host and parasite genotypes might oscillate as if they were running to stay in the same place.</p>
<p>It seems unlikely that Lewis Carroll had coevolution in mind when writing these passages. But he was a mathematician at Oxford University (his given name was Charles Dodgson), and at least one author has shown how his writings can be seen as metaphors for mathematical problems <span class="citation" data-cites="bayley2009a bayley2010a">(<a href="references.html#ref-bayley2009a" role="doc-biblioref">Bayley 2009</a>, <a href="references.html#ref-bayley2010a" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span>. Along these lines, mathematician Sanderson M. Smith <span class="citation" data-cites="smith2003a">(<a href="references.html#ref-smith2003a" role="doc-biblioref">n.d.</a>)</span> has suggested that <a href="http://www.herkimershideaway.org/writings/carroll.htm">Carroll simply inverted the equation for speed from “speed = distance/time” to “speed = time/distance.”</a> Upon rearrangement, the latter gives “distance = time/speed.” Hence you must run very fast to stay in the same place. But how does the shifting landscape fit in? And why did Alice have to go the other way to meet the Red Queen? I would love to know.</p>
<p>It is perhaps worth pointing out that the phrase “Red Queen Hypothesis” can have two different meanings to evolutionary biologists. In the early 1970s, Leigh van Valen was grappling with data showing that the probability of extinction in very different organisms was independent of the age of the lineage. He reasoned that in coevolutionary interactions, the probability of one species driving the other species extinct could, in fact, be independent of lineage age <span class="citation" data-cites="valen1973a">(<a href="references.html#ref-valen1973a" role="doc-biblioref">1973</a>)</span>. It thus seems reasonable to suggest that both antagonists must run (coevolve) as fast as they can to prevent extinction. Graham Bell repurposed the phrase to mean within-population oscillations in host and parasite genotypes <span class="citation" data-cites="bell1982a">(<a href="references.html#ref-bell1982a" role="doc-biblioref">1982</a>)</span>. Hence, Van Valen’s idea is about macroevolution (speciation/extinction), while Bell’s idea is about microevolution. Even though van Valen’s use of the Red Queen metaphor was published first, I will use Bell’s microevolutionary meaning, as it perfectly captures the oscillating nature of genotype frequencies during host-parasite coevolution.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>Part of my goal is to show science as a process. As such it seems reasonable to discuss the origins of the Red Queen idea. One of the earliest statements alluding to the Red Queen Hypothesis came from W.D. Hamilton <span class="citation" data-cites="hamilton1975a">(<a href="references.html#ref-hamilton1975a" role="doc-biblioref">1975</a>)</span>. Hamilton was reviewing the books by Williams <span class="citation" data-cites="williams1975a">(<a href="references.html#ref-williams1975a" role="doc-biblioref">1975</a>)</span> and Ghiselin <span class="citation" data-cites="ghiselin1974a">(<a href="references.html#ref-ghiselin1974a" role="doc-biblioref">1974</a>)</span> for the <em>Quarterly Review of Biology</em>. Throughout the review, the reader can feel Hamilton’s frustration with their arguments. Towards the end, he makes these very abstract suggestions: “[I]t seems to me that we need environmental fluctuations around a trend line of change” and “For the source of these we may look to fluctuations and periodicities … generated by life itself.”</p>
<p>The quote does not specifically refer to parasites, but it does suggest that coevolutionary interactions, in general, could play a role in selecting for sex and recombination. In his memoirs, Hamilton <span class="citation" data-cites="hamilton2001a">(<a href="references.html#ref-hamilton2001a" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span> clears this up, writing, “At that stage when I wrote the review, although I had not seen the particular relevance that parasitism might have, I had for many years seen sex looming ahead and had reached a stage of being excited by the possible primary role of biotic interaction. I had decided that it was in aspects of the interspecies struggle, and not survival in an inanimate environment, that I had to search for the main factor. Adaptation to new physical habitats might be made possible through sexuality but these adaptations could not be the main reason for its existence.”</p>
<p>Note that, here, Hamilton is specifically contrasting host-parasite coevolution with the Lottery Model, which relies on random changes in “physical habitats.”</p>
<p>At about the same time, a plant population biologist, Don Levin, was also writing on the paradox of sex/rec. In his paper, Levin specifically identified pathogens as a possible force selecting for recombination: “I propose that the persistent tracking of plant hosts by multiple pathogens and herbivores is a prime factor which prohibits the congealing of the genomes of species, especially those in closed communities” <span class="citation" data-cites="levin1975a">(<a href="references.html#ref-levin1975a" role="doc-biblioref">Levin 1975</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Boom! By “prohibit the congealing of genomes,” Levin means, “selects for recombination.” The reference to “closed communities” means species that are tightly coevolving in the absence of homogenizing gene flow. This quote seems to be the first to specifically identify coevolving pathogens as a primary source of selection favoring the mixing of genomes. Levin’s idea was quickly followed by important conceptual contributions by Glesener &amp; Tilman<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> <span class="citation" data-cites="glesener1978a">(<a href="references.html#ref-glesener1978a" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a>)</span>, Jaenike<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> <span class="citation" data-cites="jaenike1978a">(<a href="references.html#ref-jaenike1978a" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a>)</span>, and Lloyd <span class="citation" data-cites="lloyd1980a">(<a href="references.html#ref-lloyd1980a" role="doc-biblioref">1980</a>)</span>. In particular, Lloyd writes, “[B]iological interactions are more likely than unpredictable physical conditions to provide the kind of relentless, repetitive change that is necessary for sexual parents to be selected because of the genetic diversity that sex engenders.” Lloyd then turns this abstract idea into a specific prediction, which I would later test: “If this proves to be so, we will then be able to examine whether the occurrence of asexual reproduction is correlated with relaxation of the biological hostility of the environment.” Notice that, in the quotes presented above, both Hamilton and Lloyd were specifically predicting that coevolution is more important in selecting for sex than uncertain physical environments. But it is reasonable to ask, does it really matter? Aren’t both ideas fundamentally about bet hedging in uncertain environments? Yes: I think both ideas are about bet hedging. But the distinction still matters. The Lottery Model is about random shifts in the direction of selection; there is no selection against common genotypes unless the environment changes by chance in a way that disfavors them. By contrast, under the Red Queen, selection is frequency dependent. In fact, selection against common genotypes is the core of the model. Hence, the critical difference between the models is not so much about bet hedging but whether selection for sex/rec is directional (but randomly changing directions, a lottery) or frequency dependent (Red Queen). For example, parasites could be a source of directional selection for sex if they randomly changed which host genotypes they attacked. To my mind, that would be a Lottery Model. The Red Queen Hypothesis requires frequency-dependent selection generated by interactions between species.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> This is an important distinction.</p>
<p>Taking this view, the Red Queen Hypothesis may seem more closely related to the Tangled Bank model than to the Lottery Model, as both the Red Queen and the Tangled Bank rely on frequency-dependent selection. But the critical distinction here is that selection against common genotypes under the Tangled Bank relies on intraspecific competition in populations at carrying capacity (soft selection). The Red Queen relies on interspecific antagonistic coevolution, leading to parasite-mediated selection against common host genotypes.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>In any case, looking back, it seems clear that the architects of the ecological hypotheses had two interrelated things in mind:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How can we explain sex/rec?</li>
<li>How do we understand the biogeographic and phylogenetic distributions of asexual reproduction?</li>
</ol>
<p>As an evolutionary ecologist, I was drawn to the confluence of these questions. But other ideas were also interesting, such as the idea that sexual reproduction is favored because it reduces the interference between alleles at different loci <span class="citation" data-cites="otto2021a">(review in <a href="references.html#ref-otto2021a" role="doc-biblioref">Otto 2021</a>)</span>.

<h2 data-number="2.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-app-2"><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Appendix: Levene’s model of multiple niche polymorphism</h2>
<p>It was widely thought that heterozygote advantage was required to maintain polymorphism at a single locus with two alleles. In the introduction to his paper, Levene wonders “whether it was in fact possible to have an equilibrium without the heterozygote being superior in any single niche” <span class="citation" data-cites="levene1953a">(<a href="references.html#ref-levene1953a" role="doc-biblioref">1953</a>)</span>. The paper is not easy to follow, eventhough the algebra is not difficult. Here I try to simplify the presentation.</p>
<p>Levene first assumes that the proportion of survivors coming from the <span class="math inline">\(i^{th}\)</span> niche is constant <span class="math inline">\((q)\)</span>, independent of the genotypic composition of the niche (i.e., soft selection). He then assumes that the heterozygote has a relative fitness of one in all niches, giving <span class="math inline">\(W_{AB} = 1\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> be the frequency of allele A, and let (<span class="math inline">\(1 - q\)</span>) be the frequency of allele B. The frequency of allele A in the next generation, <span class="math inline">\(q'\)</span>, is then</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[q^{'} = \sum_{}^{}c_{i}\frac{q^{2}W_{AAi} + q(1 - q)}{q^{2}W_{AAi} + 2q(1 - q) + (1 - q)^{2}W_{BBi}}\]</span></p>
<p>The change in <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is simply <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{\Delta}q = q^{'} - q\)</span>. Under these assumptions, Levene showed that A allele will increase when rare (barring genetic drift) when |</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{\sum_{}^{}{c_{i}\frac{1}{W_{AAi}}}} &lt; 1\]</span></p>
<p>where the left-hand side gives the harmonic mean fitness for genotype AA over all niches. The right-hand-side of the equation gives the harmonic mean fitness of the heterozygous genotype, AB, which is equal to one. Similarly, the B allele will increase when rare when</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{\sum_{}^{}{c_{i}\frac{1}{W_{BBi}}}} &lt; 1\]</span></p>
<p>where the left-hand side gives the harmonic mean fitness for genotype BB over all niches. A genetic polymorphism is expected if both alleles can increase when rare; hence, <strong>polymorphism is expected, in general, when the harmonic mean fitness for the heterozygote is greater than the harmonic mean fitness for either homozygote</strong>.</p>
<p>But does this require that the AB genotype is the most fit in at least one niche? Levene gives a specific example to answer this question. He assumes two niches, where the proportion of survivors from both niches is equal (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(c_{1} = c_{2} = 0.5\)</span>). He then assumes genotypic fitness values, as given in the following table. It is important to note that the heterozygous genotype is not the most fit genotype in either niche.</p>

<p>For this example, the harmonic mean fitness for the heterozygote is greater than the harmonic mean fitness for either homozygote, thus meeting the conditions given by the equations above. Thus, the answer to Levene’s question is Yes. It is possible to have a genetic polymorphism without having heterozygote advantage in any single niche. And, interestingly, the polymorphism is expected even though the arithmetic mean fitness of the heterozygote is less than the arithmetic mean fitness of either homozygote. Finally, based on this example, it seems that a trade-off is required, such that the AA genotype does best in one niche, and the BB genotype does best in the other niche.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Levene’s result suggests that overdominance for harmonic mean fitness is required for multiple niche polymorphism <span class="citation" data-cites="prout1968a">(<a href="references.html#ref-prout1968a" role="doc-biblioref">Prout 1968</a>)</span>. However, Timothy Prout showed that a polymorphism could be stable even if one allele is dominant, thus ruling out any kind of overdominance <span class="citation" data-cites="prout1968a">(<a href="references.html#ref-prout1968a" role="doc-biblioref">1968</a>)</span>. Let both the AA and AB genotypes have a fitness of one in both niches. Let the BB genotype have a fitness of 0.5 in niche one and a fitness of 1.67 in niche two. Assuming as above that both patches are equally common, we get the following table:</p>

<p>Prout showed that there would be a stable multiple niche polymorphism even under complete dominance, provided that the arithmetic mean fitness for BB is greater than one and the harmonic mean fitness for the BB genotype is less than one. So, clearly, overdominance for harmonic mean fitness is not required for a stable polymorphism.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<li id="fn1"><p>See Bell <span class="citation" data-cites="bell1982a">(<a href="references.html#ref-bell1982a" role="doc-biblioref">1982</a>)</span> for a deeper historical view of the Lottery Model, which involves contributions by Maynard Smith and others, including Williams. I have tried to distill it down to a simple bet-hedging model here. The original formulation is more complex.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>The variance in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is equal to the average of the squared deviations from the mean: <span class="math inline">\(var(x) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{(x_{i} - \overline{x})^{2}}\)</span><a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>The geometric mean is the <span class="math inline">\(N^{th}\)</span> root of the product of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> observations. Compared to the arithmetic mean, the geometric mean gives more weight to small values.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>The bet-hedging idea dates to Daniel Bernoulli, a mathematical physicist, writing in 1738. Steve Stearns provides an important, fascinating review of how evolutionary biologists <span class="citation" data-cites="cohen1966a">(beginning with <a href="references.html#ref-cohen1966a" role="doc-biblioref">Cohen 1966</a>)</span> and economists have borrowed from Bernoulli’s conceptual framework <span class="citation" data-cites="stearns2000a">(<a href="references.html#ref-stearns2000a" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>)</span>.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>Vrijenhoek studied the coexistence of sexual fish with multiple clonal genotypes of asexual congeners in natural populations. He mainly envisioned the Frozen Niche Hypothesis as a model to explain the coexistence of multiple clones, but it can also explain the coexistence of sexual and asexual modes of reproduction if clonal diversity is low, and the clones do not compete strongly. See, for example pages 112-113 in Vrijenhoek and Parker <span class="citation" data-cites="vrijenhoek2009a">(<a href="references.html#ref-vrijenhoek2009a" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>: “The Frozen Niche Variation Model <span class="citation" data-cites="vrijenhoek1978a vrijenhoek1979a">(<a href="references.html#ref-vrijenhoek1978a" role="doc-biblioref">Vrijenhoek 1978</a>, <a href="references.html#ref-vrijenhoek1979a" role="doc-biblioref">1979</a>)</span> was directly stimulated by Roughgarden’s ideas <span class="citation" data-cites="roughgarden1972a">(<a href="references.html#ref-roughgarden1972a" role="doc-biblioref">1972</a>)</span> and a need to explain the stable coexistence of <em>Poeciliopsis</em> fish clones in spatially heterogeneous desert streams <span class="citation" data-cites="vrijenhoek1978a">(<a href="references.html#ref-vrijenhoek1978a" role="doc-biblioref">Vrijenhoek 1978</a>)</span>.”<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>Soft selection in theoretical population genetics can also mean that the contribution of offspring from different demes in a metapopulation is unrelated to differences in mean fitness among demes.<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>Wallace <span class="citation" data-cites="wallace1975a">(<a href="references.html#ref-wallace1975a" role="doc-biblioref">1975</a>)</span> explains that the source of the terms “soft” and “hard” stem from financial discussions of soft currencies versus hard currencies in monetary exchanges. Soft currencies only have value within their home country. In contrast, hard currencies can be exchanged overseas for currencies with similar buying power.<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>I use “parasite” here in the ecological sense to include any organism that lives in, or on, its host, provided it reduces the survivorship and/or fecundity of its host. As such, the term includes both macroparasites (such as worms) and microparasites (such as protozoans, bacteria, and viruses).<a href="#fnref8" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>The intersection between science and literature is not restricted to selection for or against sex. For a fascinating essay on how the biology of parasites meets literature, see Justyna Jajszczok’s dissertation <span class="citation" data-cites="jajszczok2017a">(<a href="references.html#ref-jajszczok2017a" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>.<a href="#fnref9" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>I. M. Lerner used the Red Queen metaphor as early as 1954 with respect to the selection needed to maintain genetic homeostasis: “The <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> situation in which ‘it takes all the running you can do to stay in the same place’ arises when a stationary level of performance can be maintained only by application of the maximum selection possible…” <span class="citation" data-cites="lerner1954a">(See page 117 in <a href="references.html#ref-lerner1954a" role="doc-biblioref">Lerner 1954</a>)</span>.<a href="#fnref10" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>For example, Glesener and Tilman write, “Thus, sexuality not only is favored under changed conditions but is, itself, capable of changing the conditions. The sexuality of an organism’s competitors, predators, parasites, etc., will greatly increase the selective pressure for sexuality on that organism as well” <span class="citation" data-cites="glesener1978a">(<a href="references.html#ref-glesener1978a" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a>)</span>.<a href="#fnref11" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>Jaenike focuses more on the recycling of genotypes: “My hypothesis differs from Levin’s in that sex and recombination are advantageous not to produce novel genotypes as such, but to produce rare genotypes, of which novel ones are only a subset” <span class="citation" data-cites="jaenike1978a">(<a href="references.html#ref-jaenike1978a" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a>)</span>.<a href="#fnref12" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>I use “frequency-dependent” selection here to mean selection against common genotypes. A more accurate phrase would be “negative frequency-dependent” selection.<a href="#fnref13" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>This is not meant to imply, however, that the strength of parasite-mediated selection under the Red Queen Hypothesis must be independent of population size. Indeed, as we will see, there are good reasons to think that the strength of parasite-mediated selection depends on host density.<a href="#fnref14" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn15"><p>The basic idea comes from a paper by Hill and Robertson <span class="citation" data-cites="hill1966a">(<a href="references.html#ref-hill1966a" role="doc-biblioref">1966</a>)</span> and is often called the Hill-Robertson effect <span class="citation" data-cites="felsenstein1974a">(following <a href="references.html#ref-felsenstein1974a" role="doc-biblioref">Felsenstein 1974</a>)</span>. A broader framework, housed under the more intuitive phrase “selective interference,” was recently given by Sarah Otto as part of a keynote lecture given to the American Genetic Association <span class="citation" data-cites="otto2021a">(<a href="references.html#ref-otto2021a" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>.<a href="#fnref15" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn16"><p>The harmonic mean is not intuitive to most Biology students. So, I ask them this question: If you had a score of 100 on your first exam and a score of 60 on your second exam, would you rather have your final grade calculated as the arithmetic mean or the harmonic mean of the two scores? After some thought, they all pick the arithmetic mean. That is because the harmonic mean weights low scores more heavily than high scores.<a href="#fnref16" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5"></a>The sex/recombination ("sex/rec") anomaly has attracted some of the best theoretical biologists over the last 50 years leading to at least two dozen hypotheses to explain selection for recombination and/or the persistence of obligate sexual reproduction in natural populations <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@kondrashov1993a</span><span class="co">]</span>. In what follows, I first focus on the ecological hypotheses. The ideas underlying these hypotheses provide a handle for understanding some of the foundational concepts in evolutionary ecology.  </span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7"></a><span class="fu">## The Lottery Model</span></span>
<span id="cb1-8"><a href="#cb1-8"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-9"><a href="#cb1-9"></a>As part of his book on the evolution of sex, Williams <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">-@williams1975a</span><span class="co">]</span> suggests that sex could be favored in fluctuating abiotic environments. The idea is intuitive: cross-fertilization generates variation among offspring. Hence, in fluctuating environments, sex could increase the probability that some offspring might survive. Williams likens the idea to a unique kind of lottery. For example, he writes, "Suppose you were offered this choice in a lottery: either you could have several different tickets, or you could have the same number of copies of the same ticket" (p. 15). If you choose *N* copies of the same ticket (asex) and your ticket wins, you get *N* times the reward. If you choose *N* different tickets (sex), you increase the probability of winning something, but the reward is smaller. Williams refers to the idea as the aphid-rotifer model, but the idea has since come to be known as the Lottery Model <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">following @bell1982a</span><span class="co">]</span>, which is a more descriptive phrase.<span class="ot">[^1]</span>  </span>
<span id="cb1-10"><a href="#cb1-10"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-11"><a href="#cb1-11"></a>In my evolution course, I ask a form of Williams' question but with a slight twist:  </span>
<span id="cb1-12"><a href="#cb1-12"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-13"><a href="#cb1-13"></a><span class="at">&gt; If you had a garden, upon which your descendants will depend for many generations to come, would you</span></span>
<span id="cb1-14"><a href="#cb1-14"></a><span class="at">&gt; </span></span>
<span id="cb1-15"><a href="#cb1-15"></a><span class="at">&gt; 1. plant a genetically variable crop, or</span></span>
<span id="cb1-16"><a href="#cb1-16"></a><span class="at">&gt; 2. a monoculture with a two-fold higher yield?</span>  </span>
<span id="cb1-17"><a href="#cb1-17"></a><span class="at">&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb1-18"><a href="#cb1-18"></a><span class="at">&gt; Keep in mind that your descendants will follow your choice. </span></span>
<span id="cb1-19"><a href="#cb1-19"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-20"><a href="#cb1-20"></a>Often the students rightfully want some clarification. They ask, for example, “Can we use pesticides?” But every time, most students choose the variable crop. I remind them that selecting the variable crop will reduce their yield by one half. They don't budge. I re-ask the question, doubling the relative yield for the monoculture from two-fold to four-fold. Then to 10-fold. Occasionally, one of the more risk-prone students will select the 10-fold higher yield, but most do not budge. They want genetic variation. I ask them why. Invariably, they say that the environment is going to change. They want to hedge their bets against an uncertain future. </span>
<span id="cb1-21"><a href="#cb1-21"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-22"><a href="#cb1-22"></a>Indeed, Williams' Lottery Model is about bet hedging. The gist of bet hedging in evolutionary theory is that selection can act to reduce the variance in reproductive success over time, even if it also reduces the arithmetic mean across years <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">review in @philippi1989a</span><span class="co">]</span>. Suppose, for example, that we have the following data for both a monoculture and a genetically variable polyculture (in arbitrary units). Let’s assume that the variation in yield is driven by annual variation in abiotic factors such as temperature or precipitation. The effect of planting a polyculture (bet-hedging) can be estimated from the geometric mean, which incorporates the variation in yield over time.   </span>

<span id="cb1-38"><a href="#cb1-38"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-39"><a href="#cb1-39"></a>In this example, we find that the monoculture has an arithmetic mean of 240, while the polyculture has an arithmetic mean of only 220. So, I might be inclined to plant the monoculture. However, the among-year variance is very high for the monoculture (relative to the polyculture), driven in large part by the low yields in years 4 and 5. By contrast, the geometric mean for the monoculture is 184, while the geometric mean for the polyculture is 219. Based on this, I might be inclined to plant the polyculture, as it reduces the cost of very low yield in bad years. I think the students see this intuitively. Over the long term, it is better to be risk-averse and plant the genetically variable polyculture. What if, for example, the monoculture produced no food in the last year? The geometric mean would be zero. That would be catastrophic. </span>
<span id="cb1-40"><a href="#cb1-40"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-41"><a href="#cb1-41"></a>The effect of variance on the geometric mean (GM) can be seen by an approximation <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@stearns2000a</span><span class="co">]</span>:</span>
<span id="cb1-42"><a href="#cb1-42"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-43"><a href="#cb1-43"></a>$$\text{GM} \approx \overline{x} - \frac{\text{var}(x)}{2\overline{x}}$$</span>
<span id="cb1-44"><a href="#cb1-44"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-45"><a href="#cb1-45"></a>where $\overline{x}$ is the mean, and var($x$) is the variance in $x$. Note that the approximation is equal to the arithmetic mean when the variance in $x$ is zero. Note too that the geometric mean increases as the variance in $x$ decreases. So, if selection operates to reduce the among-year variance in fitness, the outcome of selection will be reflected by an increase in the geometric mean. In general, evolutionary biologists use the geometric mean (rather than the arithmetic mean) to measure fitness over time.<span class="ot">[^4]</span></span>
<span id="cb1-46"><a href="#cb1-46"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-47"><a href="#cb1-47"></a>Can sex be favored in variable environments as a bet-hedging strategy? It seems like a very sensible idea provided that the production of genetically variable progeny reduces the among-year variance in offspring survival. But remember, under a two-fold cost of sex, asexuals can replace large populations of sexuals in tens of generations (see @sec-why-sex). So, if the Lottery Model is correct, significant environmental change must occur very rapidly. The many thousands of years between ice ages, for example, would be too long. </span>
<span id="cb1-48"><a href="#cb1-48"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-49"><a href="#cb1-49"></a><span class="fu">## The Tangled Bank / Frozen Niche-Variation Model {#sec-niche}</span></span>
<span id="cb1-50"><a href="#cb1-50"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-51"><a href="#cb1-51"></a>Roughly speaking, the Lottery Model concerns the value of producing diverse offspring in a temporally variable abiotic environment. A different kind of model instead concerns the role of competition for different resource types that vary in space. Let us first consider the Frozen Niche-Variation Hypothesis of Robert Vrijenhoek. The key idea is that the clonal derivatives of sexual ancestors "freeze" some of the genetic variation in the sexual population. This frozen genotype then determines the resource niche of the clone. It seems reasonable to assume that the niche width of a single clone would be relatively narrow compared to the niche width of the genetically diverse sexual population. So, under this idea, a clone could invade a sexual population and perhaps displace it from one of its many niches. But a single clone could not completely replace the sexual population <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@vrijenhoek1979a</span><span class="co">]</span>. This kind of process could explain those situations in which sexual and asexual females coexist, which was a major advance.<span class="ot">[^5]</span></span>
<span id="cb1-52"><a href="#cb1-52"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-53"><a href="#cb1-53"></a>A conceptually similar model was independently developed by Graham Bell: the Tangled Bank Hypothesis <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">-@bell1982a</span><span class="co">]</span>. Bell nabbed the name from the last paragraph of the *Origin of Species*, in which Darwin imagines life as an "entangled bank" of species interacting in a complex network. The core of the idea can be traced back to Howard Levene's <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">-@levene1953a</span><span class="co">]</span> pioneering model, which showed that polymorphism could be maintained in a spatially heterogeneous environment provided that different genotypes specialize on different resources. Levene's model was a major advance, as it showed that genetic diversity could be maintained without heterozygote advantage (@sec-app-2). This was also one of the first models to fuse population genetics with ecology. But how does multiple niche polymorphism apply to sex? The idea is that if selection results in polymorphism, then a genetically diverse sexual population might be resistant to replacement by a clonal lineage that specializes on only one of the available resource types (as also in the Frozen Niche-Variation Model).</span>
<span id="cb1-54"><a href="#cb1-54"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-55"><a href="#cb1-55"></a>Here is how I pose the Tangled Bank idea to my undergraduate students. I start by giving them a choice between two hypothetical resources, which occur in different parts of the room. One is pizza, the other is broccoli. They all choose pizza. The problem, of course, is that the per-person value of the pizza resource declines as the pizza-eating population grows. At some point, there will be an advantage to specializing on broccoli. This could lead to a polymorphic population composed of obligate pizza eaters and obligate broccoli eaters, where (at equilibrium) the value of both resources is the same. Hence, selection for or against a particular strategy depends on the frequency of that strategy in the population. Perhaps this kind of "frequency-dependent selection" could favor sexual reproduction as a way to diversify offspring in environments where different resource types are patchily distributed in space. This reasoning forms the essence of the Tangled Bank Hypothesis. </span>
<span id="cb1-56"><a href="#cb1-56"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-57"><a href="#cb1-57"></a>One especially interesting aspect of the Tangled Bank Model is that the strength of frequency-dependent selection depends on population density. For example, there would be no selection to utilize the resource of lower value (broccoli) if there were no competition for pizza. This kind of selection, where the advantage to being rare depends on population density, is sometimes referred to as "soft" selection <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@wallace1975a</span><span class="co">]</span>.<span class="ot">[^6]</span> In other words, soft selection is selection that is both frequency-dependent and density-dependent. This idea contrasts nicely with the Lottery Model, where selection is both frequency- and density-independent, which is called "hard" selection. For our purposes, we can use Wallace's terminology to conceptually separate the Tangled Bank Hypothesis from the Lottery Model @fig-2-2.</span>

<span id="cb1-59"><a href="#cb1-59"></a>!<span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Partitioning the ecological hypotheses for the maintenance of obligate sexual reproduction. The figure is redrawn from Wallace [-@wallace1975a]. The inserted blue text shows how the ecological hypotheses fit into Wallace’s matrix for density-dependent selection vs frequency-dependent selection. The Lottery Model relies on hard selection in temporally variable environments. The Tangled Bank relies on soft selection in spatially variable environments. The Red Queen relies on frequency-dependent selection generated by coevolving antagonistic species.</span><span class="co">](images/fig2-2_hr.png)</span>{fig-alt="" #fig-2-2 fig-scap="Partitioning the ecological hypotheses for the maintenance of obligate sexual reproduction"}</span>
<span id="cb1-60"><a href="#cb1-60"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-61"><a href="#cb1-61"></a>We can think of the contrast like this. Under the Lottery Model, changes in the environment will select against certain genotypes independent of whether they are common or rare. Selection seems unconditional (hard). Under the Tangled Bank, selection is always conditional (soft); there is an advantage to having a rare genotype, but this advantage only accrues under strong competition (high density). Soft selection may not be exactly the best possible phrase, but it contrasts nicely with hard selection.<span class="ot">[^7]</span></span>
<span id="cb1-62"><a href="#cb1-62"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-63"><a href="#cb1-63"></a>Two caveats are worth mentioning with respect to soft selection and the Tangled Bank Hypothesis. One is that polymorphism is only stable under a narrow range of patch-types frequencies. In addition, strong tradeoffs are required for the cost and benefits for morphs occupying different patches <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@maynard1980a;@lively1986a</span><span class="co">]</span> (see also @sec-app-3). The second caveat is that repeated mutation to asexual reproduction could lead to the accumulation of clonal diversity over time. Once all the niches are occupied by different specialized clones, there would be no advantage to sex. A diverse clonal population could then replace the sexual population <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@bell1982a;@vrijenhoek2009a</span><span class="co">]</span>. This second caveat applies, in general, to any model of sex that relies on frequency-dependent selection. But the ideas could work if mutations to asex are rare. And, as I mentioned, sexuals and asexuals are known to coexist in some populations, which is consistent with the Tangled Bank and Frozen Niche-Variation Hypotheses <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@vrijenhoek2009a</span><span class="co">]</span>. Coexistence, however, is also compatible with the Red Queen hypothesis, which we will now consider. </span>

<span id="cb1-65"><a href="#cb1-65"></a><span class="fu">## The Red Queen Hypothesis</span></span>
<span id="cb1-66"><a href="#cb1-66"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-67"><a href="#cb1-67"></a>The Red Queen Hypothesis is like the Lottery Model in that it focusses on environmental change over time. However, under the Red Queen idea, the change is mediated by changes in coevolving biological antagonists such as parasites, rather than changes in the abiotic environments.<span class="ot">[^8]</span> The distinction is important, as we will see.</span>
<span id="cb1-68"><a href="#cb1-68"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-69"><a href="#cb1-69"></a>It may be helpful to revisit @fig-1.2, which shows the replacement of a sexual population by a clonal lineage within 25 generations. In this example, the clone is a single genotype, while the sexual population is composed of multiple recombining genotypes, only one of which is shared with the clone. Clearly, as the clone spreads, its genotype would become the most common in the host population. Now suppose that the host population is coevolving with a parasite population, which is composed of multiple strains. Assuming random contact between hosts and parasites, the parasite strain that could infect the most common host genotype would have a selective advantage over parasite strains that could only infect rare host genotypes. Let's call this more successful parasite strain "strain **A**." What would happen? It should be easy to see that strain **A** would increase in frequency. The parasite population would evolve.</span>
<span id="cb1-70"><a href="#cb1-70"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-71"><a href="#cb1-71"></a>Now, what if the parasite dramatically reduces the reproductive success of infected hosts? We might expect that, as the parasite evolves to infect the most-common host genotype, the reproductive advantage of the host clone is eroded. Moreover, if the parasite is *common and sufficiently virulent*, evolution by the parasite could prevent the clone from eliminating the sexual population. Under this scenario, there are at least two possible outcomes. One is that the sexuals and asexuals come to exist in stable frequencies, where the lost fecundity of the clone due to infection is equal to the cost of males, meaning that the mean fitnesses of sexuals and asexuals are equal. On the other hand, if the parasite is highly virulent, the frequencies of sexuals and asexuals can oscillate over time (@fig-2-3 A). Under this second scenario, the new clone initially increases, but it is driven down sharply by infection (@fig-2-3 B). Then, once the clone becomes very rare, it should become less infected than observed in the sexual population (@fig-2-3 B). During this period, there is parasite-mediated selection against sex. Hence, the clone increases in frequency (@fig-2-3 A), only to be driven down again by parasites after it becomes common (@fig-2-3 B). Another cycle begins. **The key point is that parasites do not select against clonal reproduction per se; they only select against common genotypes.** But selection against common host genotypes might be sufficient to prevent fixation of a clone in the short term. </span>

Note that after the parasites have driven the clone's frequency down, the asexuals are less infected than the sexuals.

<span id="cb1-74"><a href="#cb1-74"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-75"><a href="#cb1-75"></a>This scenario of fluctuating selection for and against sex is just a special case of the more general idea that parasites will select against common genotypes within a diverse, sexual host population. As a rare host genotype becomes common, the parasites genotype that can infect it will be favored by natural selection. If the parasite is virulent (meaning that infection reduces host fitness), the targeted host genotype will decline in frequency, and a new host genotype will begin to increase in frequency. Under this logic, host-parasite coevolution will lead to the oscillation of genotypes in both the host and the parasite populations (@fig-2-4). These oscillations are now called Red Queen dynamics. Red Queen dynamics can lead to the maintenance of genetic polymorphism in sexual populations, and possibly protect sexual reproduction from replacement by asexual lineages. In addition, Red Queen dynamics could also favor recombination within a sexual population <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@peters1999a;@schmid-hempel2002a;@peters2007a;@salathe2008a</span><span class="co">]</span>.

<span id="cb1-79"><a href="#cb1-79"></a><span class="fu">### An intersection of science and literature</span></span>
<span id="cb1-80"><a href="#cb1-80"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-81"><a href="#cb1-81"></a>The name for the Red Queen Hypothesis comes from *Through the Looking Glass* (Carroll 1872). Here are the relevant bits of the story. After Alice goes through the looking glass (a mirror), she decides to follow a straight path to the top of a hill. But, in following the path, she ends up at her starting point. Talking to herself, she remarks, "But how curiously it twists! It's more like a corkscrew than a path." Repeated attempts were unsuccessful. In frustration, Alice addresses a tiger lily amongst a patch of flowers, "I wish you could talk!" The lily informs Alice that all the flowers can talk. The stunned Alice then begins a conversation with the flowers before finally asking, "Are there any more people in the garden besides me?" The rose answers "Yes, there is someone like you." Alice sets out to follow this person (the Red Queen), but she quickly loses sight of her, and ends up back at her original starting point. Flustered, Alice decides to follow the advice of the rose: "*I* should advise you to walk the other way." Alice then quickly finds the Red Queen. </span>
<span id="cb1-82"><a href="#cb1-82"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-83"><a href="#cb1-83"></a>Now it gets especially interesting. Alice mentions to the Red Queen that she would like to "find my way to the top of that hill." The Red Queen replies, "*I* could show you hills, in comparison with which you'd call that a valley." Alice protests: "a hill *ca'n't* be a valley.... That would be nonsense." This exchange between Alice and the Red Queen now seems prophetic, because, under frequency-dependent selection, locations on the adaptive landscape can rapidly change from fitness peaks to fitness valleys. Perhaps the Red Queen's statement is correct: hills can become valleys, and valleys can become hills. More specifically, genotypes that were favored by natural selection when rare can become selected against after they become common, leading to a highly dynamic adaptive landscape. </span>
<span id="cb1-84"><a href="#cb1-84"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-85"><a href="#cb1-85"></a>In any case, Alice had clearly entered a crazy world. Straight paths become like corkscrews, progress is made by going the other way, and hills become valleys. Then, suddenly, Alice and the Red Queen began to run: "Alice never could quite make out, in thinking it over afterwards, how it was that they began: all she remembers is, that they were running hand in hand, and the Queen went so fast that it was all she could do to keep up with her." During this furious run, Alice notices that they never pass anything. The trees remain in the same place as if they were moving along with them. Alice eventually asks: "Are we nearly there?" The Red Queen replies: "Why, we passed it ten minutes ago! Faster!"</span>
<span id="cb1-86"><a href="#cb1-86"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-87"><a href="#cb1-87"></a>When they finally stop, Alice is surprised to be where they started: "I do believe we've been under this tree the whole time! Everything's just as it was!" The Red Queen replies that of course, and then asks: "What would you have it?" Alice replies that she would have expected to get somewhere else after running for a long time. The Red Queen then replies with this very famous quote: "Now, *here*, you see, it takes all the running *you* can do to keep in the same place." It is a perfect metaphor for host-parasite coevolution.<span class="ot">[^9]</span> Host and parasite genotypes might oscillate as if they were running to stay in the same place.</span>
<span id="cb1-88"><a href="#cb1-88"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-89"><a href="#cb1-89"></a>It seems unlikely that Lewis Carroll had coevolution in mind when writing these passages. But he was a mathematician at Oxford University (his given name was Charles Dodgson), and at least one author has shown how his writings can be seen as metaphors for mathematical problems <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@bayley2009a;-@bayley2010a</span><span class="co">]</span>. Along these lines, mathematician Sanderson M. Smith <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">-@smith2003a</span><span class="co">]</span> has suggested that <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Carroll simply inverted the equation for speed from "speed = distance/time" to "speed = time/distance."</span><span class="co">](http://www.herkimershideaway.org/writings/carroll.htm)</span> Upon rearrangement, the latter gives "distance = time/speed." Hence you must run very fast to stay in the same place. But how does the shifting landscape fit in? And why did Alice have to go the other way to meet the Red Queen? I would love to know.</span>
<span id="cb1-90"><a href="#cb1-90"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-91"><a href="#cb1-91"></a>It is perhaps worth pointing out that the phrase "Red Queen Hypothesis" can have two different meanings to evolutionary biologists. In the early 1970s, Leigh van Valen was grappling with data showing that the probability of extinction in very different organisms was independent of the age of the lineage. He reasoned that in coevolutionary interactions, the probability of one species driving the other species extinct could, in fact, be independent of lineage age <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">-@valen1973a</span><span class="co">]</span>. It thus seems reasonable to suggest that both antagonists must run (coevolve) as fast as they can to prevent extinction. Graham Bell repurposed the phrase to mean within-population oscillations in host and parasite genotypes <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">-@bell1982a</span><span class="co">]</span>. Hence, Van Valen's idea is about macroevolution (speciation/extinction), while Bell's idea is about microevolution. Even though van Valen's use of the Red Queen metaphor was published first, I will use Bell's microevolutionary meaning, as it perfectly captures the oscillating nature of genotype frequencies during host-parasite coevolution.<span class="ot">[^10]</span></span>
<span id="cb1-92"><a href="#cb1-92"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-93"><a href="#cb1-93"></a><span class="fu">### Conceptual roots of the Red Queen Hypothesis</span></span>
<span id="cb1-94"><a href="#cb1-94"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-95"><a href="#cb1-95"></a>Part of my goal is to show science as a process. As such it seems reasonable to discuss the origins of the Red Queen idea. One of the earliest statements alluding to the Red Queen Hypothesis came from W.D. Hamilton <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">-@hamilton1975a</span><span class="co">]</span>. Hamilton was reviewing the books by Williams <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">-@williams1975a</span><span class="co">]</span> and Ghiselin <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">-@ghiselin1974a</span><span class="co">]</span> for the *Quarterly Review of Biology*. Throughout the review, the reader can feel Hamilton's frustration with their arguments. Towards the end, he makes these very abstract suggestions: "<span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">I</span><span class="co">]</span>t seems to me that we need environmental fluctuations around a trend line of change" and “For the source of these we may look to fluctuations and periodicities ... generated by life itself."</span>
<span id="cb1-96"><a href="#cb1-96"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-97"><a href="#cb1-97"></a>The quote does not specifically refer to parasites, but it does suggest that coevolutionary interactions, in general, could play a role in selecting for sex and recombination. In his memoirs, Hamilton <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">-@hamilton2001a</span><span class="co">]</span> clears this up, writing, "At that stage when I wrote the review, although I had not seen the particular relevance that parasitism might have, I had for many years seen sex looming ahead and had reached a stage of being excited by the possible primary role of biotic interaction. I had decided that it was in aspects of the interspecies struggle, and not survival in an inanimate environment, that I had to search for the main factor. Adaptation to new physical habitats might be made possible through sexuality but these adaptations could not be the main reason for its existence."</span>
<span id="cb1-98"><a href="#cb1-98"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-99"><a href="#cb1-99"></a>Note that, here, Hamilton is specifically contrasting host-parasite coevolution with the Lottery Model, which relies on random changes in "physical habitats."  </span>
<span id="cb1-100"><a href="#cb1-100"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-101"><a href="#cb1-101"></a>At about the same time, a plant population biologist, Don Levin, was also writing on the paradox of sex/rec. In his paper, Levin specifically identified pathogens as a possible force selecting for recombination: "I propose that the persistent tracking of plant hosts by multiple pathogens and herbivores is a prime factor which prohibits the congealing of the genomes of species, especially those in closed communities" <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@levin1975a</span><span class="co">]</span>.</span>
<span id="cb1-102"><a href="#cb1-102"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-103"><a href="#cb1-103"></a>Boom! By "prohibit the congealing of genomes," Levin means, "selects for recombination." The reference to "closed communities" means species that are tightly coevolving in the absence of homogenizing gene flow. This quote seems to be the first to specifically identify coevolving pathogens as a primary source of selection favoring the mixing of genomes. Levin's idea was quickly followed by important conceptual contributions by Glesener &amp; Tilman<span class="ot">[^11]</span> <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">-@glesener1978a</span><span class="co">]</span>, Jaenike<span class="ot">[^12]</span> <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">-@jaenike1978a</span><span class="co">]</span>, and Lloyd <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">-@lloyd1980a</span><span class="co">]</span>. In particular, Lloyd writes, "<span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">B</span><span class="co">]</span>iological interactions are more likely than unpredictable physical conditions to provide the kind of relentless, repetitive change that is necessary for sexual parents to be selected because of the genetic diversity that sex engenders." Lloyd then turns this abstract idea into a specific prediction, which I would later test: "If this proves to be so, we will then be able to examine whether the occurrence of asexual reproduction is correlated with relaxation of the biological hostility of the environment." Notice that, in the quotes presented above, both Hamilton and Lloyd were specifically predicting that coevolution is more important in selecting for sex than uncertain physical environments. But it is reasonable to ask, does it really matter? Aren't both ideas fundamentally about bet hedging in uncertain environments? Yes: I think both ideas are about bet hedging. But the distinction still matters. The Lottery Model is about random shifts in the direction of selection; there is no selection against common genotypes unless the environment changes by chance in a way that disfavors them. By contrast, under the Red Queen, selection is frequency dependent. In fact, selection against common genotypes is the core of the model. Hence, the critical difference between the models is not so much about bet hedging but whether selection for sex/rec is directional (but randomly changing directions, a lottery) or frequency dependent (Red Queen). For example, parasites could be a source of directional selection for sex if they randomly changed which host genotypes they attacked. To my mind, that would be a Lottery Model. The Red Queen Hypothesis requires frequency-dependent selection generated by interactions between species.<span class="ot">[^13]</span> This is an important distinction. </span>
<span id="cb1-104"><a href="#cb1-104"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-105"><a href="#cb1-105"></a>Taking this view, the Red Queen Hypothesis may seem more closely related to the Tangled Bank model than to the Lottery Model, as both the Red Queen and the Tangled Bank rely on frequency-dependent selection. But the critical distinction here is that selection against common genotypes under the Tangled Bank relies on intraspecific competition in populations at carrying capacity (soft selection). The Red Queen relies on interspecific antagonistic coevolution, leading to parasite-mediated selection against common host genotypes.<span class="ot">[^14]</span></span>
<span id="cb1-106"><a href="#cb1-106"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-107"><a href="#cb1-107"></a>In any case, looking back, it seems clear that the architects of the ecological hypotheses had two interrelated things in mind: </span>
<span id="cb1-108"><a href="#cb1-108"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-109"><a href="#cb1-109"></a><span class="ss">1. </span>How can we explain sex/rec?</span>
<span id="cb1-110"><a href="#cb1-110"></a><span class="ss">2. </span>How do we understand the biogeographic and phylogenetic distributions of asexual reproduction?  </span>
<span id="cb1-111"><a href="#cb1-111"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-112"><a href="#cb1-112"></a>As an evolutionary ecologist, I was drawn to the confluence of these questions. But other ideas were also interesting, such as the idea that sexual reproduction is favored because it reduces the interference between alleles at different loci <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">review in @otto2021a</span><span class="co">]</span>. I will cover some special cases of this latter idea in @sec-chap6.<span class="ot">[^15]</span> </span>

<span id="cb1-126"><a href="#cb1-126"></a><span class="fu">## Appendix: Levene's model of multiple niche polymorphism {#sec-app-2}</span></span>
<span id="cb1-127"><a href="#cb1-127"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-128"><a href="#cb1-128"></a>It was widely thought that heterozygote advantage was required to maintain polymorphism at a single locus with two alleles. In the introduction to his paper, Levene wonders "whether it was in fact possible to have an equilibrium without the heterozygote being superior in any single niche" <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">-@levene1953a</span><span class="co">]</span>. The paper is not easy to follow, eventhough the algebra is not difficult. Here I try to simplify the presentation.  </span>
<span id="cb1-129"><a href="#cb1-129"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-130"><a href="#cb1-130"></a>Levene first assumes that the proportion of survivors coming from the $i^{th}$ niche is constant $(q)$, independent of the genotypic composition of the niche (i.e., soft selection). He then assumes that the heterozygote has a relative fitness of one in all niches, giving $W_{AB} = 1$. Let $q$ be the frequency of allele A, and let ($1 - q$) be the frequency of allele B. The frequency of allele A in the next generation, $q'$, is then</span>
<span id="cb1-131"><a href="#cb1-131"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-132"><a href="#cb1-132"></a>$$q^{'} = \sum_{}^{}c_{i}\frac{q^{2}W_{AAi} + q(1 - q)}{q^{2}W_{AAi} + 2q(1 - q) + (1 - q)^{2}W_{BBi}}$$</span>
<span id="cb1-133"><a href="#cb1-133"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-134"><a href="#cb1-134"></a>The change in $q$ is simply $\mathrm{\Delta}q = q^{'} - q$. Under these assumptions, Levene showed that A allele will increase when rare (barring genetic drift) when                                     |</span>
<span id="cb1-135"><a href="#cb1-135"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-136"><a href="#cb1-136"></a>$$\frac{1}{\sum_{}^{}{c_{i}\frac{1}{W_{AAi}}}} &lt; 1$$</span>
<span id="cb1-137"><a href="#cb1-137"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-138"><a href="#cb1-138"></a>where the left-hand side gives the harmonic mean fitness for genotype AA over all niches. The right-hand-side of the equation gives the harmonic mean fitness of the heterozygous genotype, AB, which is equal to one. Similarly, the B allele will increase when rare when </span>
<span id="cb1-139"><a href="#cb1-139"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-140"><a href="#cb1-140"></a>$$\frac{1}{\sum_{}^{}{c_{i}\frac{1}{W_{BBi}}}} &lt; 1$$</span>
<span id="cb1-141"><a href="#cb1-141"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-142"><a href="#cb1-142"></a>where the left-hand side gives the harmonic mean fitness for genotype BB over all niches. A genetic polymorphism is expected if both alleles can increase when rare; hence, **polymorphism is expected, in general, when the harmonic mean fitness for the heterozygote is greater than the harmonic mean fitness for either homozygote**.  </span>
<span id="cb1-143"><a href="#cb1-143"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-144"><a href="#cb1-144"></a>But does this require that the AB genotype is the most fit in at least one niche? Levene gives a specific example to answer this question. He assumes two niches, where the proportion of survivors from both niches is equal (i.e., $c_{1} = c_{2} = 0.5$). He then assumes genotypic fitness values, as given in the following table. It is important to note that the heterozygous genotype is not the most fit genotype in either niche.                                         </span>

<span id="cb1-154"><a href="#cb1-154"></a>For this example, the harmonic mean fitness for the heterozygote is greater than the harmonic mean fitness for either homozygote, thus meeting the conditions given by the equations above. Thus, the answer to Levene's question is Yes. It is possible to have a genetic polymorphism without having heterozygote advantage in any single niche. And, interestingly, the polymorphism is expected even though the arithmetic mean fitness of the heterozygote is less than the arithmetic mean fitness of either homozygote. Finally, based on this example, it seems that a trade-off is required, such that the AA genotype does best in one niche, and the BB genotype does best in the other niche.  </span>
<span id="cb1-155"><a href="#cb1-155"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-156"><a href="#cb1-156"></a>Nonetheless, Levene's result suggests that overdominance for harmonic mean fitness is required for multiple niche polymorphism <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@prout1968a</span><span class="co">]</span>. However, Timothy Prout showed that a polymorphism could be stable even if one allele is dominant, thus ruling out any kind of overdominance <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">-@prout1968a</span><span class="co">]</span>. Let both the AA and AB genotypes have a fitness of one in both niches. Let the BB genotype have a fitness of 0.5 in niche one and a fitness of 1.67 in niche two. Assuming as above that both patches are equally common, we get the following table:</span>

<span id="cb1-166"><a href="#cb1-166"></a>Prout showed that there would be a stable multiple niche polymorphism even under complete dominance, provided that the arithmetic mean fitness for BB is greater than one and the harmonic mean fitness for the BB genotype is less than one. So, clearly, overdominance for harmonic mean fitness is not required for a stable polymorphism.<span class="ot">[^16]</span>  </span>
