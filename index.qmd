## Abstract

The following pages represent the first volume of a book. The main goal is to introduce the evolutionary problem of sexual reproduction with a focus on competition between sexual and asexual females. But I also incorporate some ideas on genetic polymorphism and phenotypic plasticity with the goal of exploring "variation strategies" more generally. Finally, I try to weave in some history of the field along with some philosophy of science.
