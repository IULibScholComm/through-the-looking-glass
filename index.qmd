## About

The following pages represent the first six chapters of a book (part 1).
The main goal was to present an introduction to the problem of sexual
reproduction, with a focus on competition between sexual and asexual
females. But I also incorporated some ideas on genetic polymorphism and
phenotypic plasticity with the aim of exploring "variation strategies"
more generally. Finally, I tried to weave in some history of the field,
along with some philosophy of science.
