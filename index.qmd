## About

The following pages represent the first volume of a book. The main goal was to introduce the evolutionary problem of sexual reproduction, with a focus on competition between sexual and asexual females. But I also incorporated some ideas on genetic polymorphism and phenotypic plasticity with the goal of exploring “variation strategies” more generally. Finally, I tried to weave in some history of the field, along with some philosophy of science.
