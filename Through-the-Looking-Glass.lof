\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.1}{\ignorespaces The cost of males. Imagine a single clonal female in a sexual population at carrying capacity, \(K_{sex}\). At \(K_{sex}\), the sexual females are, on average, producing one daughter and one son. In contrast, the clonal female produces two daughters and four granddaughters. Hence, the clonal lineage should rapidly eliminate the sexual population (Figure~\ref {fig-clonal}). However, in nature, asexual reproduction is very rare in both plants (Whitton et al.~2008) and animals (Vrijenhoek 1998). Hence the paradox. Why is sexual reproduction so costly and yet so common?}}{7}{figure.caption.11}%
