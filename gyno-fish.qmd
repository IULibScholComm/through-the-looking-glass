# Gynogenetic Fish

New Zealand felt like home after five years, and we had many good friends and colleagues in Christchurch, especially David Lloyd. David and I talked often about strategic models of natural selection (game theory), of which he was one of the world's leaders. I was particularly influenced by his idea that sexual reproduction, polymorphism, phenotypic plasticity, and hermaphroditism could all be seen under the umbrella of "variation strategies" [@lloyd1984a]. Sadly, when Lynda completed her PhD, her visa expired, and we had to leave New Zealand. But where to go? 

Lynda was a rising star when she completed her PhD. She landed a post-doc at Rutgers University to work with Tom Meagher, so we moved to New Jersey in January 1989. Once again, Lynda was supporting us. Steven Handel gave me a desk and some space in his lab. Soon afterward, Peter Morin asked me to give a seminar on sex/asex at Rutgers. I knew of Peter's pioneering work in community ecology for which he had received a young investigator's award from the Ecological Society of America (the Mercer Award). I was quite nervous to give a seminar in front of one of my heroes. Another of my heroes, Professor Bob Vrijenhoek, was also in the audience. As described in @sec-niche, Bob was the creative mind behind the Frozen Niche-Variation Hypothesis, and he was well known for his work on sexual and asexual fish (topminnows in the genus *Poeciliopsis*). He was also the director of the Center for Theoretical and Applied Genetics (CTAG) at the New Brunswick campus of Rutgers University, and he was the Editor-in-Chief of the journal *Evolution*, the most prestigious journal in evolutionary biology. After my talk, Bob, Peter, Lynda, and I went out for dinner. Somewhere in the middle of the meal, Bob offered me a post-doc to work with him at CTAG. I was dumbfounded. But I managed to say yes, "When do I start?" He said, "How about tomorrow?" 

For this to make sense, you need to know more about Vrijenhoek's fish. Like the snails, the fish have coexisting sexual (diploid) and asexual (triploid) forms. The asexual fish, however, were "gynogenetic," which means that the eggs require fertilization to kick-start embryogenesis. The sneaky eggs, however, do not generally incorporate the sperm's DNA [review in @vrijenhoek1998a].[^1] The outcome is the coexistence of sexual and asexual lineages within the same semi-isolated populations. 

Bob had worked on these fish for decades, focusing on small streams in Mexico. He had worked in particular on the coexistence of a sexual form of the fish, *Poeciliopsis monacha*, with two gynogenetic clones, which were interspecific hybrids between *P. monacha* and *P. lucida* [@vrijenhoek1978a;@vrijenhoek1979a]. The triploid clones were independently derived from their sexual ancestors, with two copies of the monacha genome and one copy of the lucida genome [@schultz1969a]. During his studies, Bob had frozen fish for many years from several of his sites. He remembered that some of the fish in his freezer were heavily infected with black-spot disease. The black spots are clearly visible on the body of the fish. The spot itself is caused by trematode larvae that burrow into the fish and encyst (genus *Uvulifer*). The fish's immune system then coats the cyst with melanin, which turns the cysts black. Bob thought it would be interesting to see if the asexual fish were more infected than the sexuals. The prediction under the Red Queen Hypothesis was that the most common asexual clones would be most infected by black spot disease (@sec-app-5).

Bob enlisted the help of one of his PhD students, Clark Craddock. Clark ran the allozyme electrophoresis, which was necessary at the time to tell sexual fish from the two clones. She also helped count the cysts, run the statistics, and write the paper. We found right away that larger fish had more cysts, which makes sense. But we also found that the most common clone, clone 1, had significantly more black spots per unit body length than the sexual fish in Log Pool (@fig-5-1 A & B). In addition, the sexual fish showed greater size-corrected variation in the number of parasitic cysts than the asexual fish, which makes sense if the sexual population contained genetic variation for resistance to infection. So, after correcting for size, the sexual fish were both less infected and showed more variation in infection than the clone 2.[^2] This seemed very promising for the Red Queen. 

Similar results were observed in a second pool (Sandal Pool) in which both clones coexisted. In this pool, clone 2 was more common than clone 1, and it was also more infected than clone 1 (@fig-5-2). However, clone 1 was not more infected than the sexual form of P. monacha, which showed that clone 1 is not inherently more susceptible to infection (Lively et al. 1990). Taken together, the results suggest that the parasites had evolved to disproportionately attack the most common local clone.

But we had more samples to run. When we examined another pool, the trend reversed: sexual fish were more infected than asexual fish (@fig-5-3 A). We were confused. I remember Clark telling Bob of this new result. He said something like, "Well, that's science," and then headed back to his office. He was halfway there when he turned around and asked, "what sample was that?" Clark told him, "Heart Pool, 1983." Bob got a big smile. Then he told us that, in that sample, the sexual fish were highly inbred. The population had descended from a small number of founders, and they were homozygous for most loci. So, the sexual fish were more infected in that sample, but they were also genetically depauperate. Under the Red Queen, there is no value to sexual reproduction unless there is genetic variation in the population. On the other hand, the greater level of infection in sexual fish might have been caused by inbreeding depression, which was known for other fitness-related traits [@vrijenhoek1982a]. 

It was an amazing set of results, but there was another twist. Bob had added some fish (in 1983) to the isolated founder population in Heart Pool. His goal was to increase the genetic diversity of the sexual population. After a few years, he resampled the site, and fortunately, he had saved the samples in his freezer from 1985. Clark and I had a look. The pattern had reversed: now the sexual fish were less infected than the asexual fish (@fig-5-3 B). In addition, the size-corrected variance in infection had increased in the sexual fish in just two years. The advantage to outcrossing seemed to depend on genetic diversity. 

In summary, the data suggested that the parasites had evolved to infect the most common local host clone in the different pools. They also suggested that sex in genetically diverse host populations results in protection from disease. Both results were consistent with the Red Queen.[^3] Proof? No. Fascinating? Yes. In any case, looking back, I was very lucky to have had the opportunity to work with Professor Vrijenhoek. 

![Number of trematode larvae infecting fish in Heart Pool. **A (top):** Heart Pool 1983 (number of sexuals = 27; number of clone 1 = 34). The sexual fish in the pool were highly inbred and they were also significantly more infected per unit length than clone 1. The result remained significant after removing the apparent outlier in the sexual population with more than 400 cysts (black spots). The residual variances in the number of cysts were not significantly different between the inbred sexual fish and clone 1. **B (bottom):** Heart Pool 1985 after the infusion of genetic variation into the pool. Here the sexual fish ($N=171$) were less infected than the coexisting clone ($N=48$), and they showed significantly greater residual variation for infection than the clone, similar to the results for Log Pool.

## Appendix: Red Queen Hypothesis Predictions {#sec-app-5}

It can be a bit confusing, but I think that the prediction of the Red Queen Hypothesis changes depending on whether one is looking **within versus between populations**. In @sec-eco-hyp-cont, I suggested that snail populations having more parasites should be more likely to have some sexual reproduction. Here I am suggesting that asexual fish would be expected to have more parasites. How does that work?

**Between populations** we would expect to find that regions without parasites would evolve to reproduce by parthenogenesis. That would tend to suggest that sex would be positively correlated with infection prevalence. The pattern would be expected to be messy, and it may not be found due to time lags, even in cases where parasites are the major driving force for sex, as suggested elsewhere [@lively2021a]. Nonetheless, the common expectation is that sex would be more common where there has been a history of strong parasite-mediated selection.

**Within populations** we might expect for asexuals to be more infected than sexuals, at least periodically. This sounds different from the expectation for between-population samples, but it is part of the same logic. If parasites are tracking common clones, then the common asexual genotypes within a population should be more infected, potentially resulting in a higher average prevalence of infection in the asexual population, even when there is more than one clone present. On the other hand, we expect sexual populations to have more parasites. 

These may sound like different predictions, but they go together. If there are few or no parasites, asexuals should win. If there are abundant parasites, sex should be maintained, perhaps in mixed populations of sexuals and asexuals. In mixed populations, we would expect common asexual genotypes to be more infected than sexual females, at least periodically. (Note that infection in males is not important, unless females become sperm limited.)

[^1]: Paternal leakage of DNA in otherwise asexual vertebrate species now seems possible [review in @lampert2010a]. 

[^2]: In a follow up study, using independent samples, Steve Weeks (one of Vrijenhoek's PhD students) was unable to replicate some of our results [@weeks1996a]. However, his sample sizes were very low, especially for clonal fish, suggesting that his power to detect differences was compromised. 

[^3]: It is important to point out that we were not claiming that parasite-mediated selection is maintaining sex in this system. For example, we wrote, "[w]e do not intend to imply from this analysis that the trematode is selecting for the maintenance of sex in these fish." Niche partitioning and/or the sperm-dependence of the gynogenetic females would most likely ensure the persistence of sexual individuals [@moore1971a; @Schenck1986a]. Our claim was simply that parasites had evolved to disproportionately infect the most common clone unless the sexual population was highly inbred.
