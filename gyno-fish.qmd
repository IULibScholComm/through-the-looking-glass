# Gynogenetic Fish

New Zealand felt like home after five years, and we had many good friends and colleagues in Christchurch, especially David Lloyd. David and I talked often about strategic models of natural selection (game theory), of which he was one of the world's leaders. I was particularly influenced by his idea that sexual reproduction, polymorphism, phenotypic plasticity, and hermaphroditism could all be seen under the umbrella of "variation strategies" [@lloyd1984a]. Sadly, when Lynda completed her PhD, her visa expired, and we had to leave New Zealand. But where to go?  

Lynda was a rising star when she completed her PhD. She landed a post-doc at Rutgers University to work with Tom Meagher, so we moved to New Jersey in January 1989. Once again, Lynda was supporting us. Steven Handel gave me a desk and some space in his lab. Soon afterward, Peter Morin asked me to give a seminar on sex/asex at Rutgers. I knew of Peter's pioneering work in community ecology for which he had received a young investigator's award from the Ecological Society of America (the Mercer Award). I was quite nervous to give a seminar in front of one of my heroes. Another of my heroes, Professor Bob Vrijenhoek, was also in the audience. As described in @sec-niche, Bob was the creative mind behind the Frozen Niche-Variation Hypothesis, and he was well known for his work on sexual and asexual fish (topminnows in the genus *Poeciliopsis*). He was also the director of the Center for Theoretical and Applied Genetics (CTAG) at the New Brunswick campus of Rutgers University, and he was the Editor-in-Chief of the journal *Evolution*, the most prestigious journal in evolutionary biology. After my talk, Bob, Peter, Lynda, and I went out for dinner. Somewhere in the middle of the meal, Bob offered me a post-doc to work with him at CTAG. I was dumbfounded. But I managed to say yes, "When do I start?" He said, "How about tomorrow?" 

For this to make sense, you need to know more about Vrijenhoek's fish. Like the snails, the fish have coexisting sexual (diploid) and asexual (triploid) forms. The asexual fish, however, were "gynogenetic," which means that the eggs require fertilization to kick-start embryogenesis. The sneaky eggs, however, do not generally incorporate the sperm's DNA [review in @vrijenhoek1998a].[^1] The outcome is the coexistence of sexual and asexual lineages within the same semi-isolated populations.  

Bob had worked on these fish for decades, focusing on small streams in Mexico. He had worked in particular on the coexistence of a sexual form of the fish, *Poeciliopsis monacha*, with two gynogenetic clones, which were interspecific hybrids between *P. monacha* and *P. lucida* [@vrijenhoek1978a;@vrijenhoek1979a]. The triploid clones were independently derived from their sexual ancestors, with two copies of the monacha genome and one copy of the lucida genome [@schultz1969a]. During his studies, Bob had frozen fish for many years from several of his sites. He remembered that some of the fish in his freezer were heavily infected with black-spot disease. The black spots are clearly visible on the body of the fish. The spot itself is caused by trematode larvae that burrow into the fish and encyst (genus *Uvulifer*). The fish's immune system then coats the cyst with melanin, which turns the cysts black. Bob thought it would be interesting to see if the asexual fish were more infected than the sexuals. The prediction under the Red Queen Hypothesis was that the most common asexual clones would be most infected by black spot disease [(Box 5.1)](#callout-5).

## Box 5.1

It can be a bit confusing, but I think that the prediction of the Red Queen Hypothesis changes depending on whether one is looking **within versus between populations**. In @sec-eco-hyp-cont, I suggested that snail populations having more parasites should be more likely to have some sexual reproduction. Here I am suggesting that asexual fish would be expected to have more parasites. How does that work?

**Between populations** we would expect to find that regions without parasites would evolve to reproduce by parthenogenesis. That would tend to suggest that sex would be positively correlated with infection prevalence. The pattern would be expected to be messy, and it may not be found due to time lags, even in cases where parasites are the major driving force for sex, as suggested elsewhere [@lively2021a]. Nonetheless, the common expectation is that sex would be more common where there has been a history of strong parasite-mediated selection.

**Within populations** we might expect for asexuals to be more infected than sexuals, at least periodically. This sounds different from the expectation for between-population samples, but it is part of the same logic. If parasites are tracking common clones, then the common asexual genotypes within a population should be more infected, potentially resulting in a higher average prevalence of infection in the asexual population, even when there is more than one clone present. On the other hand, we expect sexual populations to have more parasites.  

These may sound like different predictions, but they go together. If there are few or no parasites, asexuals should win. If there are abundant parasites, sex should be maintained, perhaps in mixed populations of sexuals and asexuals. In mixed populations, we would expect common asexual genotypes to be more infected than sexual females, at least periodically. (Note that infection in males is not important, unless females become sperm limited.)
