The following pages represent the first volume of a book. The main goal
was to introduce the evolutionary problem of sexual reproduction, with a
focus on competition between sexual and asexual females. But I also
incorporated some ideas on genetic polymorphism and phenotypic
plasticity with the goal of exploring ``variation strategies'' more
generally. Finally, I tried to weave in some history of the field, along
with some philosophy of science.

\hypertarget{the-question}{%
\section{The Question}\label{the-question}}

Most PhD programs require that students pass a preliminary examination.
This was certainly true in my case. I was a PhD student at the
University of Arizona studying rocky intertidal communities in the
Northern Gulf of California. But the exams were not focused on our
research. They were ``depth-of-knowledge'' exams. My question from
Prof.~Astrid Kodric-Brown instructed me to read the preface of G.C.
Williams' book, \emph{Sex and Evolution}, which contains the following
text (Williams 1975): ``This book is written from a conviction that the
prevalence of sexual reproduction in higher plants and animals is
inconsistent with current evolutionary theory\ldots. Many well informed
readers may disagree with much of my reasoning, but I hope to at least
convince them that here is a crisis at hand in evolutionary
biology\ldots.''''

The question was something like this: \emph{Why does Williams think that
sexual reproduction poses a crisis for evolutionary biology, and what is
the solution}? A crisis? That was news to me. How could there be a
crisis on evolutionary biology 40-plus years after the modern synthesis?
My graduate course in theoretical population genetics did not mention
any crises. I was not convinced. And a little freaked out.

The structure of our exams was very loose. I don't remember having a
deadline to produce a written answer, but I do remember that I spent
several months on just this one question. During much of this time, I
was doing field work in Sonora, Mexico, sometimes under very harsh
conditions. But the more I studied the question, the more fascinated I
became. I came to think that there was, indeed, a very real anomaly
presented by sexual reproduction. Williams was right. Perhaps I was
especially interested in this anomaly because I had read Thomas Kuhn's
``The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' as an undergraduate (Kuhn
1970). Kuhn made the case that dissecting anomalies can lead to
interesting advances, and that made sense to me. While I eventually
produced an essay to address the question, the answer felt incomplete. I
wanted to know more. There were many hypotheses, but there was no clear
general explanation. Many years later, I am still working on my prelim
question. This book is my revised answer.

\hypertarget{the-problem}{%
\section{The Problem}\label{the-problem}}

There are many problems with sexual reproduction, including the time
spent finding mates and the risk of contracting sexually transmitted
disease (review in Lehtonen et al.~2012). However, while important,
these costs do not form the core of the paradox. Historically, the
paradox of sex stems from two things: (1) the cost of meiosis, and (2)
the cost of producing males.

\hypertarget{the-cost-of-meiosis-reduced-relatedness}{%
\subsection{The cost of meiosis: reduced
relatedness}\label{the-cost-of-meiosis-reduced-relatedness}}

The ``cost of meiosis'' was proposed by George Williams (1975). His idea
was simply that females are only half as related to their outcrossed
offspring as they are to their self-fertilized or parthenogenetic
offspring.\footnote{See Bell (1982) for a deeper historical view of the
  Lottery Model, which involves contributions by Maynard Smith and
  others, including Williams. I have tried to distill it down to a
  simple bet-hedging model here. The original formulation is more
  complex.} (See \protect\hyperlink{callout-1}{Box 1.1} for condensed
definitions.) Williams' idea also had theoretical support, as R.A.
Fisher had already shown that an allele causing self-fertilization would
rapidly spread to fixation, barring severe inbreeding depression (Fisher
1941). So, why cross-fertilize? The persistence of cross-fertilization
despite the cost of meiosis formed a paradox. This paradox created the
crisis that Williams saw in evolutionary biology.

\hypertarget{the-cost-of-males}{%
\subsection{The cost of males}\label{the-cost-of-males}}

The other way to look at the problem was proposed by John Maynard Smith
(Maynard Smith 1971, 1978). Here the issue is not relatedness. The
problem stems rather from the difference between sexuals and asexuals in
their per-capita birth rates (Figure~\ref{fig-1.1}). Imagine a
population of sexual individuals at carrying capacity (\(K_{sex}\)). At
\(K_{sex}\) the sexual females are, by definition, simply replacing
themselves. This means that each sexual female is, on average, producing
one son and one daughter. Both sons and daughters contribute genetically
to the next generation, but only females give birth. Now, consider a
mutation in a single female that causes her to reproduce asexually. She
gives birth to two daughters instead of one daughter and one son. These
two asexually produced daughters both give birth to two more daughters.
Hence, after just two generations, the asexual female has four
granddaughters, while the average sexual female has just one
granddaughter (Figure~\ref{fig-1.1}). This asymmetry should lead to the
rapid replacement of sexual females by asexual females
(Figure~\ref{fig-1-2}). And by ``rapid,'' I mean within tens of
generations, even for very large populations (Lively 1996). We thus seek
a selective force that can give an advantage to sexual reproduction on a
very short time scale.

\begin{figure}

\sidecaption{\label{fig-1.1}The cost of males. Imagine a single clonal
female in a sexual population at carrying capacity, \(K_{sex}\). At
\(K_{sex}\), the sexual females are, on average, producing one daughter
and one son. In contrast, the clonal female produces two daughters and
four granddaughters. Hence, the clonal lineage should rapidly eliminate
the sexual population (Figure~\ref{fig-1-2}). However, in nature,
asexual reproduction is very rare in both plants (Whitton et al.~2008)
and animals (Vrijenhoek 1998). Hence the paradox. Why is sexual
reproduction so costly and yet so common?}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth,height=\textheight]{images/fig1-1.jpg}

}

\end{figure}

Several assumptions went into Maynard Smith\textquotesingle s model for
the cost of males. In particular, he assumed that sexual females and
asexual females make the same number of offspring, and that the
survivorship of these offspring is also the same. Maynard Smith referred
to this as the ``all-else-equal assumption.'' Unfortunately, some
authors have taken the phrase ``all-else-equal'' to mean that everything
else is exactly equal. But this is not the case. Maynard Smith did not
assume, for example, that sexuals and asexuals have the same ploidy
value.\footnote{The variance in \(x\) is equal to the average of the
  squared deviations from the mean:
  \(var(x) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{(x_{i} - \overline{x})^{2}}\)}
His model only assumes that sexual and asexual females have equal
fecundities and survivorship probabilities (see
\protect\hyperlink{callout-2}{Box 1.2}). Under this assumption, a very
rare clone would double in frequency in the next generation. Maynard
Smith called this doubling-when-rare the two-fold cost of sex.

\hypertarget{contrasting-the-costs}{%
\subsection{Contrasting the costs}\label{contrasting-the-costs}}

The two alternative costs of sex raise an immediate question. Does the
cost of sex result from reduced relatedness between mother and
offspring, or from the cost of producing males? Or is the cost some
combination of both? These questions are not easy to answer; but there
is an algebraic solution, which suggests that the (1) two costs are
mutually exclusive and (2) that they apply to different kinds of
uniparental progeny (Lively and Lloyd 1990). Roughly speaking, I think
we can adopt the following rules for the purpose of this book. When
considering the spread of a rare allele that induces self-fertilization
in hermaphrodites, the appropriate cost is Williams' cost of meiosis.
Here we have a single population in which the selfing allele is under
positive selection because it has a transmission advantage. On the other
hand, when we consider the spread of a clone into an obligately sexual
population, we are dealing with competition between two different
reproductively isolated groups. One group (the sexuals) produces males,
which do not make offspring. The other group (asexuals) produces only
females. Here the cost of sex stems from producing males. But the two
costs do not combine. The cost of sex is not four-fold.

sexual females was 1/2. The sexual population was initiated at carrying

\hypertarget{the-cost-of-recombination}{%
\subsection{The cost of recombination}\label{the-cost-of-recombination}}

There is another paradox of sexual reproduction known as the ``cost of
recombination.'' Here the competition is not between sexual and asexual
females, or between outcrossing and selfing alleles, but rather between
alleles that modify the rate of recombination. So instead of asking
``Why cross-fertilize?'' we can assume cross-fertilization and ask,
``Why is there excess crossing-over during meiosis?'' Here is the
paradox. If combinations of alleles at different loci are favored by
natural selection (because together they create high-fitness offspring),
then recombination would break these favorable allelic combinations
apart. So, it makes no obvious sense to recombine more than needed for
normal meiosis. Indeed, Lewontin (1971) formally showed that:
\emph{\ldots{} the mean fitness of the population at equilibrium is a
maximum in the absence of recombination}.\footnote{The geometric mean is
  the \(N^{th}\) root of the product of \(N\) observations. Compared to
  the arithmetic mean, the geometric mean gives more weight to small
  values.} Hence, there are two interrelated anomalies:
cross-fertilization per se and meiotic recombination. Ideally, any
theory that explains the persistence of biparental sex could also solve
the paradox of recombination. But this need not be the case. They could
have different solutions.

\textbf{Short definitions of terms as used in this book. These
definitions do not include all possible nuances.}

\textbf{Carrying capacity.} The population density at which females have
just enough food to replace themselves. Sexual females must make two
offspring to replace themselves (assuming a 1:1 sex ratio), while
asexual females must only produce one offspring. Hence, asexuals should
have higher carrying capacities, as shown in (Figure~\ref{fig-1-2}).

\textbf{Cost of males}. The reduction in the per-capita growth rate of
sexual populations due to the production of males. The cost of males is
the appropriate cost for considering sexual subpopulations in
competition with obligately asexual subpopulations.

\textbf{Cost of meiosis}. The reduction in relatedness between mother
and offspring due to outcrossing. The cost of meiosis is the appropriate
cost for considering the spread of alleles that induce
self-fertilization.

\textbf{Clone}. A lineage of parthenogenetic females descended from the
same asexual female. Members of the same clone may have small genetic
differences, which accumulate by mutation over time.

\textbf{Cross-fertilization}. The exchange of gametes between different
individuals, which may or may not be related.

\textbf{Outcrossing}. A form of cross-fertilization, which specifies
crossing between unrelated individuals.

\textbf{Parthenogenesis}. Any form of asexual reproduction through ova.

\textbf{Recombination}. Genetic exchange between homologous chromosomes
during meiosis, especially when the exchange leads to gametes with
allele combinations not represented on the parental chromosomes.

\textbf{Self-fertilization}. The fusion of gametes from the same
individual.

\textbf{Sex/rec}. Shorthand for sexual reproduction and recombination.

\textbf{Sexual reproduction}. I use the term here to mean
cross-fertilization between unrelated individuals. However, the term is
more general, and can be used to mean the incorporation of novel genetic
material by any mechanism.

\hypertarget{darwins-view}{%
\subsection{Darwin's view}\label{darwins-view}}

Even before the cost of males and meiosis were so dramatically revealed
by Williams and Maynard Smith, biologists were reckoning with the
anomaly of sex (reviews in Meirmans 2009, Dagg 2016). One of the
earliest of these biologists was Charles Darwin. After he published the
\emph{Origin of Species}, Darwin was doing hand-pollination experiments
at Down House on three species of a curious annual plant in the genus
\emph{Primula}. The plant is curious in that it has two morphs. One
morph has a style that extends beyond the anthers (the long-style
morph), and the other morph has anthers that extend beyond the style
(the short-style morph). Botanists refer to this condition as distyly
(Figure~\ref{fig-1.3}). Darwin found that crosses between the different
morphs of the same species resulted in a very successful production of
seeds, but crosses between unrelated individuals of the same morph were
dramatically less successful (Darwin 1862). In discussing these results,
Darwin speculated that the two morphs may have evolved to insure
cross-fertilization: ``Whether or not the dimorphic condition of the
\emph{Primula} has any bearing on other points in natural history, it is
valuable as showing how nature strives, if I may so express myself, to
favour the sexual union of distinct individuals of the same species.''''

Darwin then asks a killer question. Why should the union of elements
from distinct individuals be favored? Why, in fact, is there sex? ``Nor
do we know why nature should thus strive after the intercrossing of
distinct individuals. We do not even in the least know the final cause
of sexuality; why new beings should be produced by the union of the two
sexual elements, instead of by a process of parthenogenesis. The whole
subject is as yet hidden in darkness.'' Darwin's question shows that the
cross-fertilization is curious, even without considering the costs of
sex. It also shows how Darwin was drawn to anomalies on
theory\footnote{The bet-hedging idea dates to Daniel Bernoulli, a
  mathematical physicist, writing in 1738. Steve Stearns (2000) provides
  an important, fascinating review of how evolutionary biologists
  (beginning with Cohen (1966)) and economists, have borrowed from
  Bernoulli's conceptual framework.}.

It is interesting to note that, in Darwin's quote above, he switches
from discussing mechanisms to prevent self-fertilization, such as
distyly, to discussing parthenogenesis. Self-fertilization is a sexual
process (involving the formation and fusion of gametes from the same
parent), while parthenogenesis is an asexual process that does not
generally involve meiosis and syngamy (review in Bell 1982). But
parthenogenesis and self-fertilization are conceptually related, as they
are both uniparental forms of reproduction. Hence, it makes sense that
Darwin would switch back and forth between these two different forms of
uniparental reproduction. Why cross-fertilize if either selfing or
parthenogenesis is an option?

There may be another reason why Darwin pivots to parthenogenesis. Just
prior to the publication of Darwin's (1862) paper on \emph{Primula},
Carl Theodor Ernst von Siebold (1856) published his observations on the
successful development of adults from unfertilized eggs, which he called
``parthenogenesis'' (virgin birth). These were revolutionary
observations, which caught Darwin's attention. In a letter to his
mentor, J.S. Henslow, Darwin mentioned von Siebold's discovery as
follows: \emph{There is no greater mystery in the whole world, as it

However, the discovery of parthenogenesis\footnote{Vrijenhoek studied
  the coexistence of sexual fish with multiple clonal genotypes of
  asexual congeners in natural populations. He mainly envisioned the
  Frozen Niche Hypothesis as a model to explain the coexistence of
  multiple clones, but it can also explain the coexistence of sexual and
  asexual modes of reproduction if clonal diversity is low, and the
  clones do not compete strongly. See, for example pages 112-113 in
  Vrijenhoek and Parker (2009): ``The Frozen Niche-Variation Model
  (Vrijenhoek 1978, 1979) was directly stimulated by Roughgarden's
  (1972) ideas and a need to explain the stable coexistence of*
  Poeciliopsis *fish clones in spatially heterogeneous desert streams
  (Vrijenhoek 1978).''} was met with some hostility. Consider, for
example, the following statement by Rudolf Wagner in his 1857 review of
von Siebold's book on parthenogenesis {[}as translated from the original
German by Churchill (1979){]}: ``I must unfortunately say that one of
the most unpleasant of facts, {[}\emph{Parthenogenesis}{]} has been
introduced into physiology, which for the hope of so-called general laws
of animal life-phenomena \emph{is most distasteful}. It is impossible,
considering the glorification of our highly vaunted progress in the
theoretical understanding of the life processes, for it to be welcomed
or particularly encouraged; and sincerely speaking, I can be as little
pleased about it as a physicist would be if suddenly one or more
exceptions to the law of gravitation were discovered'' (Emphasis added).

Clearly, Wagner was not pleased with the discovery of asexual
reproduction, calling it unpleasant, unwelcome, and distasteful. By
contrast, Darwin did not find the idea to be distasteful in any way. He
wondered instead why it was not more common. For example, Darwin (1868)
wrote: \emph{Parthenogenesis is no longer wonderful; in fact, the wonder
is that it should not oftener occur}.\footnote{Soft selection in
  theoretical population genetics can also mean that the contribution of
  offspring from different demes in a metapopulation is unrelated to
  differences in mean fitness among demes.}

Over 100 years later, W. D. Hamilton (1975) was also pondering the
evolution of outcrossing, and he wrote something conceptually similar:
``\ldots complete inbreeding abandons the obviously important advantages
of sexual reproduction, whatever these are.''''

Whatever these are! The advantages of outcrossing were obviously
important because cross-fertilization is so dominant. But the source of
these advantages was not clear. At about the same time, Maynard Smith
(1976) mused: ``One gets the feeling that some essential feature of the
situation has been overlooked.''

I now think that John Maynard Smith was correct. An essential feature
had indeed been overlooked: parasites.

Maynard Smith's (1978) model showing the cost of producing
males.\footnotemark{} Let \(N_{asex}\) be the number of asexual females
at time 1, while \(N_{sex}\) gives the total number of sexual
individuals (males plus females) at time 1. Let \(B_{asex}\) give the
number of offspring produced by asexual females, and \(S_{asex}\) gives
the survival probability of asexual offspring to maturity. The number of
surviving asexual offspring is then \(= B_{asex}S_{asex}\). Similarly,
let \(B_{sex}\) be the number offspring produced by sexual females, and
let \(S_{sex}\) give the survival probability of sexually produced
offspring. Maynard Smith assumed that all individuals reproduce once and
then die. Let \(r\) be the frequency of females in the sexual
population. The number of asexuals and sexuals at time 2 can then be
calculated as is the table below. (Note, we do not assume that the
population is at carrying capacity).

\end{longtable}

The fold increase in frequency of asexuals, \(F\), is the ratio of the
frequency of asexuals at time 2 divided by the frequency of asexuals at
time 1 giving:

\[F = \frac{N_{asex}(S_{asex}B_{asex})}{N_{asex}(S_{asex}B_{asex}) + r(N_{sex}S_{sex}B_{sex})}/\frac{N_{asex}}{N_{asex} + N_{sex}}\]

Under the all-else-equal assumption, \(S_{asex} = S_{sex}\) and
\(B_{asex} = B_{sex}\), giving:

\[F = \frac{N_{asex}}{N_{asex} + rN_{sex}}/\frac{N_{asex}}{N_{asex} + N_{sex}}\]

Assuming that there is a single asexual female at time 1, we get

\[F = \frac{1}{1 + rN_{sex}}/\frac{1}{1 + N_{sex}} = \frac{1 + N_{sex}}{1 + rN_{sex}}\]

If \(N_{sex}\) is very large, the solution reduces to \(F \approx 1/r\).
Hence, the fold increase in the frequency of asexuals, \(F\), is
inversely related to the frequency of females \((r)\) in the sexual
subpopulation. Assuming a 1:1 sex ratio, \(r = 0.5\). Hence, for an
equal sex ratio, the increase in asexuals is \(\approx\) 2-fold. This
result gives the two-fold cost of males. Assuming ``all-else-equal'' a
clone will double when rare when introduced into a large sexual
population.

The sex/recombination (``sex/rec'') anomaly has attracted some of the
best theoretical biologists over the last 50 years, leading to at least
two dozen hypotheses to explain selection for recombination and/or the
persistence of obligate sexual reproduction in natural populations
(Kondrashov 1993). In what follows, I first focus on the ecological
hypotheses. The ideas underlying these hypotheses provide a handle for
understanding some of the foundational concepts in evolutionary ecology.

\hypertarget{the-lottery-model}{%
\section{The Lottery Model}\label{the-lottery-model}}

As part of his book on the evolution of sex, Williams (1975) suggested
that sex could be favored in fluctuating abiotic environments. The idea
is intuitive: cross-fertilization generates variation among offspring.
Hence, in fluctuating environments, sex could increase the probability
that some offspring might survive. Williams likened the idea to a unique
kind of lottery. For example, he wrote: ``Suppose you were offered this
choice in a lottery: either you could have several different tickets, or
you could have the same number of copies of the same ticket'' (p.~15).
If you choose \emph{N} copies of the same ticket (asex), and your ticket
wins, you get \emph{N} times the reward. If you choose \emph{N}
different tickets (sex), you increase the probability of winning
something, but the reward is smaller. Williams referred to the idea as
the aphid-rotifer model, but the idea has since come to be known as the
Lottery Model (following Bell 1982), which is a more descriptive
phrase.\footnote{See Bell (1982) for a deeper historical view of the
  Lottery Model, which involves contributions by Maynard Smith and
  others, including Williams. I have tried to distill it down to a
  simple bet-hedging model here. The original formulation is more
  complex.}

In my evolution course, I ask a form of Williams' question, but with a
slight twist:

\begin{quote}
If you had a garden, upon which your descendants will depend for many
generations to come, would you

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  plant a genetically variable crop, or
\item
  a monoculture with a two-fold higher yield?
\end{enumerate}

Keep in mind that your descendants will follow your choice.
\end{quote}

Often the students rightfully want some clarification. They ask, for
example, ``Can we use pesticides?'' But every time, most students choose
the variable crop. I remind them that selecting the variable crop will
reduce their yield by one half. They don't budge. I re-ask the question,
doubling the relative yield for the monoculture from two-fold to
four-fold. Then to 10-fold. Occasionally, one of the more risk-prone
students will select the 10-fold higher yield, but most do not budge.
They want genetic variation. I ask them why. Invariably, they say that
the environment is going to change. They want to hedge their bets
against an uncertain future.

Indeed, Williams' Lottery Model is about bet hedging. The gist of
bet-hedging in evolutionary theory is that selection can act to reduce
the variance in reproductive success over time, even if it also reduces
the arithmetic mean across years (review in Philippi and Seger 1989).
Suppose, for example, that we have the following data for both a
monoculture and a genetically variable polyculture (in arbitrary units).
Let's assume that the variation in yield is driven by annual variation
in abiotic factors, such as temperature or precipitation. The effect of
planting a polyculture (bet-hedging) can be estimated from the geometric
mean, which incorporates the variation in yield over time.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}

\textbf{Arithmetic mean} & \textbf{240} & 220 \\
\textbf{Variance}\footnote{The variance in \(x\) is equal to the average
  of the squared deviations from the mean:
  \(var(x) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{(x_{i} - \overline{x})^{2}}\)}
& 19400 & 600 \\
\textbf{Geometric mean (GM)}\footnote{The geometric mean is the
  \(N^{th}\) root of the product of \(N\) observations. Compared to the
  arithmetic mean, the geometric mean gives more weight to small values.}
& 184 & \textbf{219} \\
\textbf{Approximate GM} & 200 & \textbf{219} \\
\end{longtable}

In this example, we find that the monoculture has an arithmetic mean of
240, while the polyculture has an arithmetic mean of only 220. So, I
might be inclined to plant the monoculture. However, the among-year
variance is very high for the monoculture (relative to the polyculture),
driven in large part by the low yields in years 4 and 5. By contrast,
the geometric mean for the monoculture is 184, while the geometric mean
for the polyculture is 219. Based on this, I might be inclined to plant
the polyculture, as it reduces the cost of very low yield in bad years.
I think the students see this intuitively. Over the long term, it is
better to be risk-averse and plant the genetically variable polyculture.
What if, for example, the monoculture produced no food in the last year?
The geometric mean would be zero. That would be catastrophic.

The effect of variance on the geometric mean (GM) can be seen by an
approximation (Stearns 2000):

\[\text{GM} \approx \overline{x} - \frac{\text{var}(x)}{2\overline{x}}\]

where \(\overline{x}\) is the mean, and var(\(x\)) is the variance in
\(x\). Note that the approximation is equal to the arithmetic mean when
the variance in \(x\) is zero. Note too that the geometric mean
increases as the variance in \(x\) decreases. So, if selection operates
to reduce the among-year variance in fitness, the outcome of selection
will be reflected by an increase in the geometric mean. In general,
evolutionary biologists use the geometric mean (rather than the
arithmetic mean) to measure fitness over time.\footnote{The bet-hedging
  idea dates to Daniel Bernoulli, a mathematical physicist, writing in
  1738. Steve Stearns (2000) provides an important, fascinating review
  of how evolutionary biologists (beginning with Cohen (1966)) and
  economists, have borrowed from Bernoulli's conceptual framework.}

Can sex be favored in variable environments as a bet-hedging strategy?
It seems like a very sensible idea, provided that the production of
genetically variable progeny reduces the among-year variance in
offspring survival. But remember, that under a two-fold cost of sex,
asexuals can replace large populations of sexuals in tens of generations
(see chapter 1). So, if the Lottery Model is correct, significant
environmental change must occur very rapidly. The many thousands of
years between ice ages, for example, would be too long.

\hypertarget{the-tangled-bankfrozen-niche-variation-model}{%
\section{The Tangled Bank/Frozen Niche-Variation
Model}\label{the-tangled-bankfrozen-niche-variation-model}}

Roughly speaking, the Lottery Model concerns the value of producing
diverse offspring in a temporally variable abiotic environment. A
different kind of model instead concerns the role of competition for
different resource types that vary in space. Let us first consider the
Frozen Niche-Variation Hypothesis of Robert Vrijenhoek. The key idea is
that the clonal derivatives of sexual ancestors ``freeze'' some of the
genetic variation in the sexual population. This frozen genotype then
determines the resource niche of the clone. It seems reasonable to
assume that the niche width of a single clone would be relatively narrow
compared to the niche width of the genetically diverse sexual
population. So, under this idea, a clone could invade a sexual
population, and perhaps displace it from one of its many niches. But a
single clone could not completely replace the sexual population
(Vrijenhoek 1979). This kind of process could explain those situations
in which sexual and asexual females coexist, which was a major
advance.\footnote{Vrijenhoek studied the coexistence of sexual fish with
  multiple clonal genotypes of asexual congeners in natural populations.
  He mainly envisioned the Frozen Niche Hypothesis as a model to explain
  the coexistence of multiple clones, but it can also explain the
  coexistence of sexual and asexual modes of reproduction if clonal
  diversity is low, and the clones do not compete strongly. See, for
  example pages 112-113 in Vrijenhoek and Parker (2009): ``The Frozen
  Niche-Variation Model (Vrijenhoek 1978, 1979) was directly stimulated
  by Roughgarden's (1972) ideas and a need to explain the stable
  coexistence of* Poeciliopsis *fish clones in spatially heterogeneous
  desert streams (Vrijenhoek 1978).''}

A conceptually similar model was independently developed by Graham Bell:
the Tangled Bank Hypothesis (Bell 1982). Bell nabbed the name from the
last paragraph of the \emph{Origin of Species}, in which Darwin imagines
life as an ``entangled bank'' of species interacting in a complex
network. The core of the idea can be traced back to Howard Levene's
(1953) pioneering model, which showed that polymorphism could be
maintained in a spatially heterogeneous environment provided that
different genotypes specialize on different resources. Levene's model
was a major advance, as it showed that genetic diversity could be
maintained without heterozygote advantage
(\protect\hyperlink{callout-2.1}{Box 2.1}). This was also one of the
first models to fuse population genetics with ecology. But how does
multiple niche polymorphism apply to sex? The idea is that, if selection
results in polymorphism, then a genetically diverse sexual population
might be resistant to replacement by a clonal lineage that specializes
on only one of the available resource types (as also in the Frozen
Niche-Variation Model).

Here is how I pose the Tangled Bank idea to my undergraduate students. I
start by giving them a choice between two hypothetical resources, which
occur in different parts of the room. One is pizza, the other is
broccoli. They all choose pizza. The problem, of course, is that the
per-person value of the pizza resource declines as the pizza-eating
population grows. At some point, there will be an advantage to
specializing on broccoli. This could lead to a polymorphic population
composed of obligate pizza eaters and obligate broccoli eaters, where
(at equilibrium) the value of both resources is the same. Hence,
selection for or against a particular strategy depends on the frequency
of that strategy in the population. Perhaps this kind of
\emph{frequency-dependent selection} could favor sexual reproduction as
a way to diversify offspring in environments where different resource
types are patchily distributed in space. This reasoning forms the
essence of the Tangled Bank Hypothesis.

One especially interesting aspect of the Tangled Bank Model is that the
strength of frequency-dependent selection depends on population density.
For example, there would be no selection to utilize the resource of
lower value (broccoli) if there were no competition for pizza. This kind
of selection, where the advantage to being rare depends on population
density, is sometimes referred to as ``soft'' selection (Wallace
1975).\footnote{Soft selection in theoretical population genetics can
  also mean that the contribution of offspring from different demes in a
  metapopulation is unrelated to differences in mean fitness among
  demes.} In other words, soft selection is selection that is both
frequency-dependent and density-dependent. This idea contrasts nicely
with the Lottery Model, where selection is both frequency- and
density-independent, which is called ``hard'' selection. For our
purposes, we can use Wallace's terminology to conceptually separate the
Tangled Bank Hypothesis from the Lottery Model Figure~\ref{fig-2-2}.

\begin{figure}

\sidecaption{\label{fig-2-2}Partitioning the ecological hypotheses for
the maintenance of obligate sexual reproduction. The figure is redrawn
from Wallace (1975). The inserted blue text shows how the ecological
hypotheses fit into Wallace's matrix for density-dependent selection vs
frequency-dependent selection. The Lottery Model relies on hard
selection in temporally variable environments. The Tangled Bank relies
on soft selection in spatially variable environments. The Red Queen
relies on frequency-dependent selection generated by coevolving
antagonistic species.}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth,height=\textheight]{images/fig2-2.jpeg}

}

\end{figure}

We can think of the contrast like this. Under the Lottery Model, changes
in the environment will select against certain genotypes independent of
whether they are common or rare. Selection seems unconditional (hard).
Under the Tangled Bank, selection is always conditional (soft); there is
an advantage to having a rare genotype, but this advantage only accrues
under strong competition (high density). Soft selection may not be
exactly the best possible phrase, but it contrasts nicely with hard
selection.\footnote{Wallace (1975) explains that the source of the terms
  ``soft'' and ``hard'' stem from financial discussions of soft
  currencies vs hard currencies in monetary exchanges. Soft currencies
  only have value within their home country. In contrast, hard
  currencies can be exchanged overseas for currencies with similar
  buying power.}

Two caveats are worth mentioning with respect to soft selection and the
Tangled Bank Hypothesis. One is that polymorphism is only stable under a
narrow range of patch-types frequencies. In addition, strong tradeoffs
are required for the cost and benefits for morphs occupying different
patches (Maynard Smith and Hoekstra 1980, Lively 1986a) (see also
\protect\hyperlink{callout-3.1}{Box 3.1}). The second caveat is that
repeated mutation to asexual reproduction could lead to the accumulation
of clonal diversity over time. Once all the niches are occupied by
different specialized clones, there would be no advantage to sex. A
diverse clonal population could then replace the sexual population (Bell
1982, Vrijenhoek and Parker 2009). This second caveat applies, in
general, to any model of sex that relies on frequency-dependent
selection. But the ideas could work if mutations to asex are rare. And,
as I mentioned, sexuals and asexuals are known to coexist in some
populations, which is consistent with the Tangled Bank and Frozen
Niche-Variation Hypotheses (Vrijenhoek and Parker 2009). Coexistence,
however, is also compatible with the Red Queen hypothesis, which we will
now consider.

\hypertarget{the-red-queen-hypothesis}{%
\section{The Red Queen Hypothesis}\label{the-red-queen-hypothesis}}

The Red Queen Hypothesis is like the Lottery Model in that it focusses
on environmental change over time. However, under the Red Queen idea,
the change is mediated by changes in coevolving biological antagonists
such as parasites, rather than changes in the abiotic
environments.\footnote{I use ``parasite'' here in the ecological sense
  to include any organism that lives in, or on, its host, provided it
  reduces the survivorship and/or fecundity of its host. As such, the
  term includes both macroparasites (such as worms) and microparasites
  (such as protozoans, bacteria, and viruses).} The distinction is
important, as we will see.

It may be helpful to revisit Figure~\ref{fig-1-2}, which shows the
replacement of a sexual population by a clonal lineage within 25
generations. In this example, the clone was a single genotype, while the
sexual population was composed of multiple recombining genotypes, only
one of which was shared with the clone. Clearly, as the clone spreads,
its genotype would become the most common in the host population. Now
suppose that the host population is coevolving with a parasite
population, which is composed of multiple strains. Assuming random
contact between hosts and parasites, the parasite strain that could
infect the most common host genotype would have a selective advantage
over parasite strains that could only infect rare host genotypes. Let's
call this more successful parasite strain ``strain \textbf{A}.'' What
would happen? It should be easy to see that strain \textbf{A} would
increase in frequency. The parasite population would evolve.

Now, what if the parasite dramatically reduces the reproductive success
of infected hosts? We might expect that, as the parasite evolves to
infect the most-common host genotype, the reproductive advantage of the
host clone is eroded. Moreover, if the parasite is \emph{common and
sufficiently virulent}, evolution by the parasite could prevent the
clone from eliminating the sexual population. Under this scenario, there
are at least two possible outcomes. One is that the sexuals and asexuals
come to exist in stable frequencies, where the lost fecundity of the
clone due to infection is equal to the cost of males, meaning that the
mean fitnesses of sexuals and asexuals are equal. On the other hand, if
the parasite is highly virulent, the frequencies of sexuals and asexuals
can oscillate over time (Figure~\ref{fig-2-3} A). Under this second
scenario, the new clone initially increases, but it is driven down
sharply by infection (Figure~\ref{fig-2-3} B). Then, once the clone
becomes very rare, it should become less infected than observed in the
sexual population (Figure~\ref{fig-2-3} B). During this period, there is
parasite-mediated selection against sex. Hence, the clone increases in
frequency (Figure~\ref{fig-2-3} A), only to be driven down again by
parasites after it becomes common (Figure~\ref{fig-2-3} B). Another
cycle begins. \textbf{The key point is that parasites do not select
against clonal reproduction per se; they only select against common
genotypes.} But selection against common host genotypes might be
sufficient to prevent fixation of a clone in the short term.

\begin{figure}

\sidecaption{\label{fig-2-3}Simulation model showing that coevolving
parasites can prevent the fixation of asexuals in the short term.

\textbf{B.} The frequency of infection in sexual and asexual individuals

sexual population at carrying capacity. After the clone becomes common
(\textbf{A}) the parasites evolve to ``target'' it for infection
(\textbf{B}). Note that after the parasites have driven the clone's
frequency down, the asexuals are less infected than the sexuals.

as a positive function of host density.}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/fig2-3.jpg}

}

\end{figure}

This scenario of fluctuating selection for and against sex is just a
special case of the more general idea that parasites will select against
common genotypes within a diverse, sexual host population. As a rare
host genotype becomes common, the parasites genotype that can infect it
will be favored by natural selection. If the parasite is virulent
(meaning that infection reduces host fitness), the targeted host
genotype will decline in frequency, and a new host genotype will begin
to increase in frequency. Under this logic, host-parasite coevolution
will lead to the oscillation of genotypes in both the host and the
parasite populations (Figure~\ref{fig-2-4}). These oscillations are now
called Red Queen dynamics. Red Queen dynamics can lead to the
maintenance of genetic polymorphism in sexual populations, and possibly
protect sexual reproduction from replacement by asexual lineages. In
addition, Red Queen dynamics could also favor recombination within a
sexual population (Peters and Lively 1999, Schmid-Hempel and Jokela
2002, Peters and Lively 2007, Salathe et al.~2008). These related ideas
are now called the Red Queen Hypothesis (following Bell 1982).

single host genotype is shown along with the frequency of the only

\subsection{An intersection of science and
literature}\label{an-intersection-of-science-and-literature}}

The name for the Red Queen Hypothesis comes from \emph{Through the
Looking Glass} (Carroll 1872). Here are the relevant bits of the story.
After Alice goes through the looking glass (a mirror), she decides to
follow a straight path to the top of a hill. But, in following the path,
she ends up at her starting point. Talking to herself, she remarks,
``But how curiously it twists! It's more like a corkscrew than a path.''
Repeated attempts were unsuccessful. In frustration, Alice addresses a
tiger lily amongst a patch of flowers, ``I wish you could talk!'' The
lily informs Alice that all the flowers can talk. The stunned Alice then
begins a conversation with the flowers before finally asking, \emph{Are
there more people in the garden besides me?} The rose answers \emph{yes,
there is someone like you.} Alice sets out to follow this person (the
Red Queen), but she quickly loses sight of her, and ends up back at her
original starting point. Flustered, Alice decides to follow the advice
of the rose: ``I should advise you to walk the other way.'' Alice then
quickly finds the Red Queen.

Now it gets especially interesting. Alice mentions to the Red Queen that
she would like to ``find my way to the top of the hill.'' The Red Queen
replies: ``I could show you hills in comparison with which you'd call
that a valley.'' Alice protests: ``a hill ca'n't be a valley\ldots{}
That would be nonsense.'' This exchange between Alice and the Red Queen
now seems prophetic, because, under frequency-dependent selection,
locations on the adaptive landscape can rapidly change from fitness
peaks to fitness valleys. Perhaps the Red Queen's statement is correct:
hills can become valleys, and valleys can become hills. More
specifically, genotypes that were favored by natural selection when rare
can become selected against after they become common, leading to a
highly dynamic adaptive landscape.

In any case, Alice had clearly entered a crazy world. Straight paths
become like corkscrews, progress is made by going the other way, and
hills become valleys. Then, suddenly, Alice and the Red Queen began to
run: ``Alice never could quite make out, in thinking afterwards, how it
was that they began: all she remembers is, that they were running hand
in hand, and the Queen went so fast that it was all she could do to keep
up with her.'' During this furious run, Alice notices that they never
pass anything. The trees remain in the same place as if they were moving
along with them. Alice eventually asks: ``Are we nearly there?'' The Red
Queen replies: ``Why, we passed it ten minutes ago! Faster!''

When they finally stop, Alice is surprised to be where they started: ``I
do believe we have been under this tree the whole time! Everything is
just as it was!'' The Red Queen replies that of course, and then asks:
``What would you have it?'' Alice replies that she would have expected
to get somewhere else after running for a long time. The Red Queen then
replies with this very famous quote: ``Now, \emph{here}, you see, it
takes all the running \emph{you} can do to keep in the same place.'' It
is a perfect metaphor for host-parasite coevolution\footnote{The
  intersection between science and literature is not restricted to
  selection for or against sex. For a fascinating essay on how the
  biology of parasites meets literature, see Justyna Jajszczok's
  dissertation (Jajszczok 2017).}. Host and parasite genotypes might
oscillate as if they were running to stay in the same place.

It seems unlikely that Lewis Carroll had coevolution in mind when
writing these passages. But he was a mathematician at Oxford University
(his given name was Charles Dodgson), and at least one author has shown
how his writings can be seen as metaphors for mathematical problems
(Bayley 2009, 2010). Along these lines, mathematician Sanderson M. Smith
has suggested that
\href{http://www.herkimershideaway.org/writings/carroll.htm}{Carroll
simply inverted the equation for speed from ``speed = distance/time'' to
``speed = time/distance''}. Upon rearrangement, the latter gives
``distance = time/speed.'' Hence you must run very fast to stay in the
same place. But how does the shifting landscape fit in? And why did
Alice have to go the other way to meet the Red Queen? I would love to
know.

It is perhaps worth pointing out that the phrase ``Red Queen
Hypothesis'' can have two different meanings to evolutionary biologists.
In the early 1970s, Leigh van Valen was grappling with data showing that
the probability of extinction in very different organisms was
independent of the age of the lineage. He reasoned that, in
coevolutionary interactions, the probability of one species driving the
other species extinct could, in fact, be independent of lineage age (Van
Valen 1973). It thus seems reasonable to suggest that both antagonists
must run (coevolve) as fast as they can to prevent extinction. Graham
Bell repurposed the phrase to mean within-population oscillations in
host and parasite genotypes (Bell 1982). Hence, Van Valen's idea is
about macroevolution (speciation/extinction), while Bell's idea is about
microevolution. Even though van Valen's use of the Red Queen metaphor
was published first, I will use Bell's microevolutionary meaning, as it
perfectly captures the oscillating nature of genotype frequencies during
host-parasite coevolution.\footnote{I. M. Lerner used the Red Queen
  metaphor as early as 1954, with respect to the selection needed to
  maintain genetic homeostasis: ``The \emph{Alice in Wonderland}
  situation in which `it takes all the running you can do to stay in the
  same place' arises when a stationary level of performance can be
  maintained only by application of the maximum selection
  possible\ldots{}'' (See page 117 in Lerner (1954)).}

\subsection{Conceptual roots of the Red Queen
Hypothesis}\label{conceptual-roots-of-the-red-queen-hypothesis}}

Part of my goal is to show science as a process. As such it seems
reasonable to discuss the origins of the Red Queen idea. One of the
earliest statements alluding to the Red Queen Hypothesis came from W.D.
Hamilton (1975). Hamilton was reviewing the books by Williams (1975) and
Ghiselin (1974) for the \emph{Quarterly Review of Biology}. Throughout
the review, the reader can feel Hamilton's frustration with their
arguments. Towards the end, he makes this very abstract suggestion:
``\ldots it seems to me that we need environmental fluctuations around a
trend line of change'' and ``For the source of these we may look to
fluctuations and periodicities \ldots{} generated by life itself.''

The quote does not specifically refer to parasites, but it does suggest
that coevolutionary interactions, in general, could play a role in
selecting for sex and recombination. In his memoirs, Hamilton clears
this up, writing: ``At that stage when I wrote the review, although I
had not seen the particular relevance that parasitism might have, I had
for many years seen sex looming ahead and had reached a stage of being
excited by the possible primary role of biotic interaction. I had
decided that it was in aspects of the interspecies struggle, and not
survival in an inanimate environment, that I had to search for the main
factor. Adaptation to new physical habitats might be made possible
through sexuality but these adaptations could not be the main reason for
its existence (Hamilton 2001).''

Note that, here, Hamilton is specifically contrasting host-parasite
coevolution with the Lottery Model, which relies on random changes in
``physical habitats.''

At about the same time, a plant population biologist, Don Levin, was
also writing on the paradox of sex/rec. In his paper, Levin specifically
identified pathogens as a possible force selecting for recombination
(Levin 1975): ``I propose that the persistent tracking of plant hosts by
multiple pathogens and herbivores is a prime factor which prohibits the
congealing of the genomes of species, especially those in closed
communities.''

Boom! By ``prohibit the congealing of genomes,'' Levin means, ``selects
for recombination.'' The reference to ``closed communities'' means
species that are tightly coevolving in the absence of homogenizing gene
flow. This quote seems to be the first to specifically identify
coevolving pathogens as a primary source of selection favoring the
mixing of genomes. Levin's idea was quickly followed by important
conceptual contributions by Glesener \& Tilman (1978)\footnote{For
  example, Glesener and Tilman write: ``Thus, sexuality not only is
  favored under changed conditions but is, itself, capable of changing
  the conditions. The sexuality of an organism's competitors, predators,
  parasites, etc., will greatly increase the selective pressure for
  sexuality on that organism as well.''}, Jaenike (1978)\footnote{Jaenike
  focuses more on the recycling of genotypes: ``My hypothesis differs
  from Levin's in that sex and recombination are advantageous not to
  produce novel genotypes as such, but to produce rare genotypes, of
  which novel ones are only a subset.''}, and Lloyd (1980). In
particular, Lloyd writes: ``\ldots{} biological interactions are more
likely than unpredictable physical conditions to provide the kind of
relentless, repetitive change that is necessary for sexual parents to be
selected because of the genetic diversity that sex engenders.''

Lloyd then turns this abstract idea into a specific prediction, which I
would later test: ``If this proves to be so, we will then be able to
examine whether the occurrence of asexual reproduction is correlated
with relaxation of the biological hostility of the environment.'' Notice
that, in the quotes presented above, both Hamilton and Lloyd were
specifically predicting that coevolution is more important in selecting
for sex than uncertain physical environments. But it is reasonable to
ask, does it really matter? Aren't both ideas fundamentally about bet
hedging in uncertain environments? Yes: I think both ideas are about bet
hedging. But the distinction still matters. The Lottery Model is about
random shifts in the direction of selection; there is no selection
against common genotypes unless the environment changes by chance in a
way that disfavors them. By contrast, under the Red Queen, selection is
frequency dependent. In fact, selection against common genotypes is the
core of the model. Hence, the critical difference between the models is
not so much about bet hedging but whether selection for sex/rec is
directional (but randomly changing directions, a lottery) or frequency
dependent (Red Queen). For example, parasites could be a source of
directional selection for sex if they randomly changed which host
genotypes they attacked. To my mind, that would be a Lottery Model. The
Red Queen Hypothesis requires frequency-dependent selection generated by
interactions between species.\footnote{I use ``frequency-dependent''
  selection here to mean selection against common genotypes. A more
  accurate phrase would be ``negative frequency-dependent'' selection.}
This is an important distinction.

Taking this view, the Red Queen Hypothesis may seem more closely related
to the Tangled Bank model than to the Lottery Model, as both the Red
Queen and the Tangled Bank rely on frequency-dependent selection. But
the critical distinction here is that selection against common genotypes
under the Tangled Bank relies on intraspecific competition in
populations at carrying capacity (soft selection). The Red Queen relies
on interspecific antagonistic coevolution, leading to parasite-mediated
selection against common host genotypes.\footnote{This is not meant to
  imply, however, that the strength of parasite-mediated selection under
  the Red Queen Hypothesis must be independent of population size.
  Indeed, as we will see, there are good reasons to think that the
  strength of parasite-mediated selection depends on host density.}

In any case, looking back, it seems clear that the architects of the
ecological hypotheses had two inter-related things in mind:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  How can we explain sex/rec, and
\item
  How do we understand the biogeographic and phylogenetic distributions
  of asexual reproduction?
\end{enumerate}

As an evolutionary ecologist, I was drawn to the confluence of these
questions. But other ideas were also interesting, such as the idea that
sexual reproduction is favored because it reduces the interference
between alleles at different loci (review in Otto 2021). I will cover
some special cases of this latter idea in
Chapter~\ref{sec-chap6}.\footnote{The basic idea comes from a paper by
  Hill and Robertson (1966), and is often called the Hill-Robertson
  effect (following Felsenstein 1974). A broader framework, housed under
  the more intuitive phrase ``selective interference,'' was recently
  given by Sarah Otto as part of a keynote lecture given to the American
  Genetic Association (Otto 2021).}

\hypertarget{summary-1}{%
\section{Summary}\label{summary-1}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Three ecological hypotheses have been proposed to explain the
  persistence of cross-fertilization in the face of competition with
  uniparental reproductive strategies such as parthenogenesis or
  self-fertilization (following Bell 1982).
\item
  The Lottery Model is based on the possible advantages of diversifying
  offspring facing uncertain changes in the abiotic environment. Here
  selection is independent of both density and frequency.
\item
  The Tangled Bank and Frozen Niche-Variation Hypotheses are based on
  competition for resources when multiple resource types co-occur.
  Selection is frequency dependent, but the advantage to rare types only
  occurs when intraspecific competition is intense.
\item
  The Red Queen Hypothesis relies on parasite-mediated selection against
  common host genotypes. Such selection, when strong, can result in
  oscillatory changes in parasite and host alleles. These oscillations
  are sometimes called Red Queen dynamics.
\item
  A bet-hedging strategy reduces the variance in reproductive success
  over time, even if it reduces the arithmetic mean. Sexual reproduction
  under the Lottery Model is clearly a bet-hedging strategy. The Red
  Queen idea can perhaps also be seen as bet hedging.

Levene's model of multiple niche polymorphism.}, left=2mm, leftrule=.75mm]

It was widely thought that heterozygote advantage was required to
maintain polymorphism at a single locus with two alleles. In the
introduction to his paper, Levene wonders ``\ldots whether it was in
fact possible to have an equilibrium without the heterozygote being
superior in any single niche.'' The paper is not easy to follow, even
though the algebra is not difficult. Here I try to simplify the
presentation.

Levene first assumes that the proportion of survivors coming from the
\(i^{th}\) niche is constant \((q)\), independent of the genotypic
composition of the niche (i.e., soft selection). He then assumes that
the heterozygote has a relative fitness of 1 in all niches, giving
\(W_{AB} = 1\). Let \(q\) be the frequency of allele A, and let
(\(1 - q\)) be the frequency of allele B. The frequency of allele A in
the next generation, \(q'\), is then

\[q^{'} = \sum_{}^{}c_{i}\frac{q^{2}W_{AAi} + q(1 - q)}{q^{2}W_{AAi} + 2q(1 - q) + (1 - q)^{2}W_{BBi}}\]

The change in \(q\) is simply \(\mathrm{\Delta}q = q^{'} - q\). Under
these assumptions, Levene showed that A allele will increase when rare
(barring genetic drift) when \textbar{}

\[\frac{1}{\sum_{}^{}{c_{i}\frac{1}{W_{AAi}}}} < 1\]

where the left-hand side gives the harmonic mean fitness for genotype AA
over all niches. The right-hand-side of the equation gives the harmonic
mean fitness of the heterozygous genotype, AB, which is equal to 1.
Similarly, the B allele will increase when rare when

\[\frac{1}{\sum_{}^{}{c_{i}\frac{1}{W_{BBi}}}} < 1\]

where the left-hand side gives the harmonic mean fitness for genotype BB
over all niches. A genetic polymorphism is expected if both alleles can
increase when rare, hence \textbf{polymorphism is expected when, in
general, when the harmonic mean fitness for the heterozygote is greater
than the harmonic mean fitness for either homozygote}.

But does this require that the AB genotype is the most fit in at least
one niche? Levene gives a specific example to answer this question. He
assumes two niches, where the proportion of survivors from both niches
is equal (i.e., \(c_{1} = c_{2} = 0.5\)). He then assumes genotypic
fitness values, as given in the following table. It is important to note
that the heterozygous genotype is not the most fit genotype in either
niche.

\end{longtable}

For this example, the harmonic mean fitness for the heterozygote is
greater than the harmonic mean fitness for either homozygote, thus
meeting the conditions given by the equations above. Thus, the answer to
Levene's question is yes. It is possible to have a genetic polymorphism
without having heterozygote advantage in any single niche. And,
interestingly, the polymorphism is expected even though the arithmetic
mean fitness of the heterozygote is less than the arithmetic mean
fitness of either homozygote. Finally, based on this example, it seems
that a trade-off is required, such that the AA genotype does best in one
niche, and the BB genotype does best in the other niche.

Nonetheless, Levene's result suggests that overdominance for harmonic
mean fitness is required for multiple niche polymorphism (Prout 1968).
However, Timothy Prout showed that a polymorphism could be stable, even
if one allele is dominate, thus ruling out any kind of overdominance
(Prout 1968). Let both the AA and AB genotypes have a fitness of 1 in
both niches. Let the BB genotype have a fitness of 0.5 in niche 1 and a
fitness of 1.67 in niche 2. Assuming as above that both patches are
equally common, we get the following table.

Prout showed that there would be a stable multiple niche polymorphism,
even under complete dominance, provided that the arithmetic mean fitness
for BB is greater than 1, and that the harmonic mean fitness for the BB
genotype is less than 1. So, clearly, overdominance for harmonic mean
fitness is not required for a stable polymorphism.

The papers by Levene (1953) and Prout (1968) helped to lay the
foundation for the fusion of population genetics and population
ecology.\footnote{The harmonic mean is not intuitive to most Biology
  students. So, I ask them this question: if you had a score of 100 on
  your first exam, and a score of 60 on your second exam, would you
  rather have your final grade calculated as the arithmetic mean or the
  harmonic mean of the two scores? After some thought, they all pick the
  arithmetic mean.}

\chapter{The Ratchet and the Red Queen}\label{sec-chap6}}

In 1988, Indiana University advertised for an assistant professor in
population biology, with emphasis on disease ecology. Lynda and I both
applied. Happily, we were offered a split position in Biology in which
we each got half salary. It may not sound like a good deal, but we were
thrilled. It is not easy for a dual-career couple in the same field. We
relocated to Bloomington in January of 1990, arriving during a cold snap
(-20\&degC). We moved into a university house; but we did not know
enough to have the electricity turned on before arrival. Luckily, we
still had our down sleeping bags, which we had purchased for field work
in the Southern Alps. Aside from the chilly start, moving to Bloomington
was the beginning of an academic dream come true. Most of this book aims
to highlight the work of my incredible students and colleagues at IU.
