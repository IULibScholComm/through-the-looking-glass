# Self/Non-Self Recognition and Local Adaptation

One way to falsify the Red Queen is to experimentally show that the expectations of the hypothesis are not met. One expectation is that parasites would quickly become adapted to infecting their local host populations. Here is the logic. If parasites are closely tracking common host genotypes in their local (sympatric) populations, then they should be better, on average, at infecting sympatric hosts than foreign (allopatric) hosts. If this is not the case, then parasites would seem unlikely (at least to me) to be a factor selecting for sexual reproduction.  

I am often asked why we would expect the parasites to be better at infecting their local hosts instead of the opposite. Why shouldn't hosts evolve to be more resistant to their local parasites than to allopatric parasites? It is a fair question. One common answer is that parasites are locally adapted to host populations because they have faster generation times. But that cannot be the whole answer. Theory has shown that parasites can be locally adapted even when there is no generation-time asymmetry [@lively1999a; @gandon2002a]. Instead, I think the answer has more to do with the underlying genetic basis for infection.  

What, then, is the genetic basis for infection? This was unknown, but I was assuming that all animal hosts have a self/non-self recognition system, such that they can detect foreign tissues (e.g., parasites or tissue grafts) that do not match their own. Sponges, for example, accept tissue grafts from self, but reject grafts from unrelated individuals of the same species [review in @gaino1999a]. This ability to reject foreign tissues seems widely conserved [@buss1990a]. I was also assuming that the self-/non-self-recognition system is genetically variable and that different host genotypes would dominate in different populations. Parasite genotypes that match the most common local host genotypes would be favored by natural selection, and these parasite genotypes should increase in frequency. This should lead to local adaptation by the parasites. Fortunately, one can test for local adaptation using reciprocal cross-inoculation experiments.  

## Experimental Studies of Local Adaption

While I was still a post-doc in New Zealand, I set up two reciprocal cross-inoculation experiments to test for local adaptation by the parasites. I knew from my field surveys that one species of sterilizing trematode was especially common in lake populations of the snail. This species was not formally described, but Jan McKenzie sent it to a trematode expert in France, who thought it belonged in the genus *Microphallus*; hence I will refer to it as *Microphallus* sp.[^1] The life cycle of *Microphallus* turns out to be especially crucial to the story. The adult worms are tiny simultaneous hermaphrodites that live in the intestines of ducks. They cross-fertilize and produce eggs that are shed with the duck feces into the environment. In most trematodes, the eggs normally hatch in water, thereby releasing a swimming larval stage (miracidia), which actively swims to and penetrates the body of snails. This is the case for the trematodes that cause the human disease, Schistosomiasis. But, in this New Zealand species of *Microphallus*, the eggs hatch not in the environment but rather after being ingested by snails. The larvae then penetrate the snail from the inside. If the snail's immune system does not recognize the larvae as foreign tissue, the larvae reproduce asexually, producing several hundred cysts (metacercaria) in the snail. These cysts completely replace the reproductive tissue in both males and females. Infected snails are sterilized (@fig-4.1).

They produce cross-fertilized eggs, which are released into lakes and streams with the birdâ€™s feces. The eggs hatch following ingestion by snails. Infection results in the asexual production of hundreds of cysts (called metacercaria). These cysts "hatch" and mature following ingestion by ducks, thus completing the life cycle.

[^1]: The trematode worm was not formally described until 30 years later [@blasco-costa2019a]. As it turns out, it belongs in the genus *Atriophallophorus*, rather than *Microphallus*, and it was very appropriately named after Mike Winterbourn: *A. winterbourni*. But I am going to call it *Microphallus* in this book, as that is what we called it in our early papers.
